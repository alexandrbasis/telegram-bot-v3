### Fixed
- **Asyncio Best Practices Verification and Documentation Enhancement** - Comprehensive verification confirming modern asyncio patterns already implemented throughout the codebase with proactive documentation improvements (TDB-52, PR #25, completed 2025-09-07)
  - Verified repository already uses `asyncio.to_thread()` for all blocking Airtable operations with no `run_in_executor()` usage found (`src/data/airtable/airtable_client.py:443-449` and across all CRUD methods)
  - Confirmed 44/44 Airtable client unit tests pass, validating proper implementation of modern asyncio patterns with rate limiting and error handling intact
  - Repository-wide scan verified zero occurrences of legacy `run_in_executor()` patterns in application code (`src/` directory clean)
  - Static code quality checks confirmed: flake8 clean, mypy shows existing baseline issues in unrelated modules with no new errors introduced
  - Enhanced documentation with comprehensive "Asynchronous Programming Standards" section covering `asyncio.to_thread()` best practices (`docs/development/coding-standards.md`)
  - Added "Asynchronous Operation Patterns" section documenting modern asyncio patterns already implemented throughout the codebase (`docs/technical/performance-considerations.md`)

### Changed

### Fixed
- **Participant Edit Display Regression Resolution** - Fixed critical regression where participants saw no information during field editing, breaking the complete participant display feature and degrading user experience (PR #14, AGB-22, completed 2025-09-02)
  - Root cause fix for `current_participant` becoming None during field editing sessions, causing handlers to fall back to simple messages instead of displaying complete participant information (`src/bot/handlers/edit_participant_handlers.py:428-484,580-631`)
  - Enhanced error handling with comprehensive try-catch blocks around `display_updated_participant()` calls, detailed logging with REGRESSION markers for production debugging, and meaningful user feedback when context is lost
  - Save success enhancement implementing complete participant information display using `format_participant_result()` instead of simple confirmation messages, fulfilling business requirement specifications (`src/bot/handlers/edit_participant_handlers.py:797-810`)
  - Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation ensuring users receive clear recovery guidance instead of silent failures, maintaining field-specific icons in all scenarios
  - Regression prevention with 11 new comprehensive tests covering exception handling in display functions, button field display exceptions, context corruption scenarios, save success behavior, and multiple field editing integrity (`tests/unit/test_bot_handlers/test_edit_participant_handlers.py:851-1171`)
  - Production support with REGRESSION markers in logs enabling proactive monitoring and debugging of similar context loss issues in production environments
  - Complete backward compatibility maintaining all existing edit workflow state transitions, error handling patterns, and Russian language interface consistency
  - Enhanced user experience recovery ensuring participants maintain complete visual context throughout editing sessions and see full participant information after successful saves
  - All 41 tests passing with zero regressions introduced, comprehensive coverage of error scenarios and edge cases for future regression prevention
  - Users now see complete updated participant information after each field edit and save operation, restoring intended functionality and enhancing experience beyond original specifications
- **Participant Search Button Functionality Restoration** - Fixed critical search button malfunction preventing users from initiating participant searches (PR #10, SHA: 001b1e5, merged 2025-08-31T17:40:00)
  - Resolved state collision between SearchStates enum (0-2) and EditStates enum (0-2) causing ConversationHandler conflicts where EditStates handlers overwrote SearchStates handlers at identical numeric values (`src/bot/handlers/search_handlers.py:25-27`)
  - Fixed ConversationHandler CallbackQueryHandler tracking issue by adding proper per_message=None configuration for mixed handler types (`src/bot/handlers/search_conversation.py:91`)
  - Updated SearchStates enum values from (0,1,2) to (10,11,12) preventing future state collisions with other conversation handlers
  - Restored "🔍 Поиск участников" button functionality enabling successful transition from MAIN_MENU → WAITING_FOR_NAME states
  - Fixed UserInteractionLogger method signatures resolving runtime errors in production code (`src/bot/handlers/edit_participant_handlers.py`)
  - Corrected integration test mocking for `repository.search_by_name_enhanced` method ensuring proper test result validation (`tests/integration/test_bot_handlers/test_search_conversation.py:166-175`)
  - Resolved main application test failures by fixing settings mock configurations: `settings.logging.level` → `settings.logging.log_level` and `settings.telegram.token` → `settings.telegram.bot_token` (`tests/integration/test_main.py`)
  - Added comprehensive regression test suite preventing future search button failures (`tests/unit/test_search_button_regression.py`, `tests/unit/test_per_message_functionality.py`)
  - Complete code review resolution addressing 2 critical, 2 major, and 1 minor issue with all tests passing (16+ tests including new regression coverage)
  - Users can now successfully click the search button to initiate participant search conversations without errors or non-responsive behavior
- **Enhanced Documentation with Troubleshooting and Architecture Updates** - Updated 4 technical documentation files with ConversationHandler diagnostics, state collision prevention patterns, and regression testing procedures
  - Enhanced troubleshooting guide with ConversationHandler state diagnostics and callback handler debugging procedures (`docs/technical/troubleshooting.md`)
  - Updated architecture overview with state collision prevention best practices and ConversationHandler configuration guidance (`docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md`)  
  - Enhanced testing strategy with regression testing methodology for button functionality and conversation handler validation (`docs/development/testing-strategy.md`)
