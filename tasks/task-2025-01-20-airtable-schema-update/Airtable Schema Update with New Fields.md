## Business Requirements
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-01-20

### Business Context
Ensure accurate data model synchronization between Telegram bot and Airtable database with newly added fields.

### Primary Objective
Update all Airtable schema documentation, field mappings, and data models to reflect two new fields (`DateOfBirth` and `Age`) that have been added to the production Airtable base, ensuring complete accuracy and preventing data integration issues.

### Use Cases
1. **Schema Validation Scenario**: Developers can reference up-to-date documentation to understand all available fields and their properties
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All field IDs, types, and constraints are accurately documented for both new fields
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Field mapping configurations include complete bidirectional mapping for new fields
   
2. **Data Model Integration Scenario**: Bot operations can handle new fields without errors when processing Airtable records
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Participant model includes both new fields with proper validation
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Airtable conversion methods support new fields in both directions (to/from Airtable format)

3. **Future Development Scenario**: New features requiring date of birth or age data can be built on accurate foundation
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Documentation includes field constraints, validation rules, and usage examples
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Test fixtures and validation tests cover new field scenarios

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Schema documentation matches 100% of actual Airtable field structure
- [ ] All field mappings pass validation tests without errors
- [ ] Data model successfully converts new fields to/from Airtable format
- [ ] No integration errors when processing records with new fields

### Constraints
- Must use existing Airtable credentials and API access
- No UI/editing functionality for new fields (explicitly out of scope)
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing field processing
- Changes must not affect current bot operations

## Test Plan
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-01-20

### Test Coverage Strategy
Target: 90%+ coverage across all implementation areas

### Proposed Test Categories

#### Business Logic Tests
- [ ] **New field validation test**: Verify DateOfBirth accepts valid date formats and rejects invalid ones
- [ ] **Age field constraint test**: Verify Age accepts integers within reasonable range (0-120)
- [ ] **Field mapping completeness test**: Verify all new fields are included in Python↔Airtable mappings
- [ ] **Participant model creation test**: Verify Participant instances can be created with new fields

#### State Transition Tests  
- [ ] **Airtable record conversion test**: Verify records with new fields convert properly to/from Participant model
- [ ] **Field ID mapping test**: Verify new field names map correctly to their Airtable field IDs
- [ ] **Backward compatibility test**: Verify existing records without new fields still process correctly

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] **Missing field graceful handling**: Verify bot doesn't crash when new fields are None/empty
- [ ] **Invalid date format handling**: Verify proper error handling for malformed DateOfBirth values
- [ ] **Schema validation failure test**: Verify clear error messages when field constraints are violated

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Airtable API field discovery test**: Verify we can fetch actual field IDs and properties from live Airtable
- [ ] **Complete schema sync test**: Verify documentation matches actual Airtable base structure 100%
- [ ] **Field mapping validation test**: Verify all documented fields exist in actual Airtable base

#### User Interaction Tests
- [ ] **Record processing test**: Verify bot can process participant records containing new fields without errors
- [ ] **Data preservation test**: Verify new field data is preserved through all conversion operations
- [ ] **Model serialization test**: Verify Participant model with new fields serializes/deserializes correctly

### Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- **Schema Validation Scenario** → Tests: Field mapping completeness, Schema validation failure, Complete schema sync
- **Data Model Integration Scenario** → Tests: Participant model creation, Airtable record conversion, Backward compatibility
- **Future Development Scenario** → Tests: New field validation, Field ID mapping, Data preservation

### Task Splitting Evaluation
**Status**: ✅ Evaluated | **Evaluated by**: Task Splitter Agent | **Date**: 2025-01-20
**Decision**: No Split Needed - Single Task
**Reasoning**: Task is appropriately sized for a single pull request (~50-75 lines of changes), has tightly coupled steps, and represents a single atomic schema synchronization concern.

### Constraints
- Must use existing Airtable credentials from environment variables
- Cannot modify existing field structures or break current functionality
- New fields must be optional to maintain backward compatibility
- Documentation must be complete and accurate before implementation is considered done

## Notes for Other Devs
- Both new fields (DateOfBirth and Age) are semantically related and should be implemented together
- Follow existing optional field patterns in the Participant model
- Schema discovery script should validate against live Airtable data before updating configurations
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing records
