# Task: Add Floor and Room Number Fields to Participant Model
**Created**: 2025-09-03 | **Status**: Ready for Review (2025-09-03)

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - ✅ APPROVED)

### Primary Objective
Extend the participant data model to include Floor and Room Number fields that were added to the original Airtable database, enabling complete accommodation information tracking for event participants.

### Use Cases
1. **Accommodation Assignment Display**: Bot users can view complete participant accommodation details including floor level and specific room number when searching for participants
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Search results display both Floor and Room Number fields when available
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Fields display as "N/A" or appropriate placeholder when not set in Airtable

2. **Complete Participant Profile Access**: Administrative users can access and edit all participant accommodation information including floor and room assignments
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Edit interface includes Floor and Room Number fields
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Save operations successfully update both fields in Airtable

3. **Accommodation Data Synchronization**: System automatically pulls Floor and Room Number data from existing Airtable records without data loss
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Existing participant records retain all current data
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: New fields are populated from Airtable where available

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of participant search results include Floor and Room Number information when available in Airtable
- [ ] Edit functionality successfully updates Floor and Room Number fields with validation feedback
- [ ] Zero data loss during field integration deployment
- [ ] All existing bot functionality remains fully operational

### Constraints
- Must use existing Airtable credentials to validate field types and data structure
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing participant data
- Must follow established repository and service patterns
- Must include comprehensive test coverage for new fields
- Cannot break existing search, edit, or display functionality

## Implementation Progress

- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Model: Add `floor` and `room_number` to `src/models/participant.py`
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Mappings: Add Airtable mappings in `src/config/field_mappings.py` (names; IDs TBD via schema sync)
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Repository: Support partial updates for new fields in `src/data/airtable/airtable_participant_repo.py`
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Update Service: Validate `floor` (int or text) and `room_number` (alphanumeric) in `src/services/participant_update_service.py`
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Search Display: Include "Floor: X, Room: Y" in `src/services/search_service.py` with N/A fallbacks
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Edit UI: Add fields to edit menu and prompts in `src/bot/keyboards/edit_keyboards.py` and `src/bot/handlers/edit_participant_handlers.py`
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full test coverage implementation (deferred from previous developer, now complete)
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED** - PR creation and formal code review (PR #17 created)

## Notes on Airtable Schema

- Field IDs for `Floor` and `RoomNumber` are not yet added to `AIRTABLE_FIELD_IDS`.
- Client safely falls back to field names if IDs are unknown; update IDs after running schema discovery.
- Method: Use `src/data/airtable/airtable_client.py` `get_schema()` method to discover fields

## Changelog (Implementation)

- src/models/participant.py: Added `floor`, `room_number`; mapped in `to_airtable_fields()` and `from_airtable_record()`
- src/config/field_mappings.py: Added python↔airtable names; field types/constraints for `Floor`, `RoomNumber`
- src/data/airtable/airtable_participant_repo.py: Allowed `floor`, `room_number` in update field mapping
- src/services/participant_update_service.py: Validation for `floor` and `room_number`; labels for Russian display
- src/services/search_service.py: Output includes Floor/Room in result and full display
- src/bot/keyboards/edit_keyboards.py: Added edit buttons for Floor and Room Number with icons
- src/bot/handlers/edit_participant_handlers.py: Show/edit new fields; added prompts; include in reconstruction

## Testing Handoff

- Per request, test implementation is deferred to another developer.
- Scope to cover (reference approved Test Plan above):
  - Model serialization/deserialization for `floor`/`room_number`
  - Validation service edge cases for both fields
  - Search and full display formatting (N/A fallbacks)
  - Edit flow prompts, save path, and repository update mapping
  - Airtable schema discovery and Field ID updates
