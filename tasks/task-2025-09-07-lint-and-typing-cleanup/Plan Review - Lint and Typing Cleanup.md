Task: tasks/task-2025-09-07-lint-and-typing-cleanup/Task - Lint and Typing Cleanup.md  
Status: âœ… APPROVED (Ready for Implementation)

## Summary
Scope is well-defined and low-risk. Changes are formatting and typing-only with explicit constraint to avoid behavior changes. Verification relies on static analysis and existing unit tests. No blockers identified.

## Recommendations
- Proceed as planned, commit in small steps by file/module.
- Keep commit messages explicit (lint-only vs type-only) for easy review.

## Acceptance
Approved for implementation. Update Linear after branch creation.
