# Test Plan: Lint and Typing Cleanup
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Created**: 2025-09-07 | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-09-07

## Test Coverage Strategy
Primary verification relies on static analysis (flake8, mypy) and regression safety through the existing unit test suite. No functional changes are introduced; no new tests required.

## Proposed Test Categories
### Business Logic Tests
- Not applicable (no logic changes). Verify zero diff in behavior via existing unit tests.

### State Transition Tests  
- Not applicable (no dialog/state changes).

### Error Handling Tests
- Not applicable (no runtime error path changes). Ensure unit tests still pass.

### Integration Tests
- Not applicable (no IO/API changes). Ensure existing integration tests remain green if run locally.

### User Interaction Tests
- Not applicable (no UI/UX or bot conversation changes).

## Verification Commands
- Lint: `./venv/bin/flake8 src tests`
- Typing: `./venv/bin/mypy src --no-error-summary`
- Unit tests: `./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit -q`

## Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- Business Requirement 1 (Zero flake8 violations) → Lint command returns no output/errors
- Business Requirement 2 (Zero mypy errors) → mypy returns 0 errors for scoped modules
- Regression safety (No behavior change) → All unit tests remain green
