### Primary Objective
Enable users to view and edit 3 new participant fields (ChurchLeader, TableName, Notes) that have been added to the Airtable database structure.

### Use Cases
1. **Church Leadership Tracking**

   - Acceptance Criteria: Field must be displayed in participant details and be editable with proper validation

2. **Event Seating Management**
   - Users can assign and modify TableName for participants to manage event seating arrangements
   - Acceptance Criteria: Field must support free-text input and be saved correctly to Airtable

3. **Extended Information Capture**
   - Users can add/edit multiline Notes for participants to capture special requirements or administrative information
   - Acceptance Criteria: Notes field must support multiline text entry and preserve formatting

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All 3 new fields are visible when viewing participant details after search
- [ ] All 3 new fields can be edited and saved successfully to Airtable
- [ ] Notes field supports multiline text entry and preserves formatting
- [ ] Users receive clear feedback when saving changes with new fields

### Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing participant records
- Must handle optional nature of all new fields (none are required)
- Must follow existing UI/UX patterns for consistency

## Test Plan
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-01-14

### Test Coverage Strategy

  - Verifies all 3 new fields appear in participant edit interface after search
  - Tests transition from search results to edit mode
- [ ] **Field Modification State Test**
  - Tests state changes when users modify ChurchLeader, TableName, or Notes fields
  - Verifies unsaved changes tracking and display

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] **Airtable API Failure Recovery Test**
  - Tests behavior when Airtable API fails during save with new fields
  - Verifies error messages and retry mechanisms
- [ ] **Field Length Validation Test**
  - Tests handling of extremely long text input in ChurchLeader and TableName
  - Validates Notes field with large multiline content
- [ ] **Invalid Character Handling Test**
  - Tests special characters, emojis, and Unicode in all 3 text fields

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Airtable Round-trip Test**
  - Creates participant with new fields, saves to Airtable, retrieves and verifies data integrity
  - Tests field mapping: ChurchLeader→fldbQr0R6nEtg1nXM, TableName→fldwIopXniSHk94v9, Notes→fldL4wmlV9de1kKa1
- [ ] **Participant Model Integration Test**
  - Tests participant model extension with new fields
  - Validates to_airtable_fields() and from_airtable_record() methods handle new fields

#### User Interaction Tests

  - End-to-end test: search participant → view details → edit new fields → save → verify
- [ ] **Field Display Formatting Test**
  - Tests proper display of ChurchLeader and TableName in participant details
  - Tests multiline Notes field formatting in Telegram interface
- [ ] **Save/Cancel Workflow Test**
  - Tests save confirmation with new fields populated
  - Tests cancel workflow preserving original values for new fields

### Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- **Church Leadership Tracking** → Tests: ChurchLeader Field Validation, Edit Mode Field Display, Search to Edit Workflow
- **Event Seating Management** → Tests: TableName Field Processing, Field Display Formatting, Save/Cancel Workflow
- **Extended Information Capture** → Tests: Notes Multiline Text Handling, Invalid Character Handling, Airtable Round-trip
