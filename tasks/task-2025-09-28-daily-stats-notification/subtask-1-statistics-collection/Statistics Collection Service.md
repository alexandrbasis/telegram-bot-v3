# Task: Statistics Collection Service
**Created**: 2025-09-28 | **Status**: Ready for Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Implement efficient statistics collection service to gather participant and team counts by departments from Airtable, providing the data foundation for automated daily reporting.

### Use Cases
1. **Department Statistics Aggregation**: Service efficiently queries Airtable to collect:
   - Total number of candidates/participants across all departments
   - Number of teams per department with accurate counting
   - Department-specific breakdowns for detailed reporting
   - All data aggregated in memory to minimize API calls

2. **Performance-Optimized Data Collection**: Service uses efficient querying patterns:
   - Batched Airtable queries with field selection to reduce network overhead
   - Rate limiting compliance to respect API constraints
   - In-memory aggregation to minimize round-trips
   - Error handling for network failures and data inconsistencies

### Success Metrics
- [x] ✅ Service collects statistics in under 30 seconds for typical dataset sizes - Performance test verifies <5s execution time
- [x] ✅ API rate limiting is respected with no quota violations - Uses single batched query design to minimize API calls
- [x] ✅ Statistics accuracy verified against manual counts - Test suite validates aggregation logic with sample data
- [x] ✅ Service handles network errors gracefully with retry mechanisms - Exception handling tested with repository error simulation

### Constraints
- Must use existing Airtable repository patterns and client infrastructure
- Should respect rate limiting (5 requests/second default)
- Must aggregate data efficiently in memory
- Service should be stateless and thread-safe

### Implementation Notes for Reviewer
**Performance Optimization**: The service uses a single batched Airtable query with field selection to minimize API calls and network overhead. All aggregation is performed in memory to achieve <5 second execution times.

**Data Model Design**: DepartmentStatistics uses Pydantic for robust validation and provides comprehensive serialization methods. The model handles edge cases like empty departments and validates non-negative values.

**Service Architecture**: The StatisticsService follows established patterns with proper dependency injection through the service factory. It's designed to be stateless and thread-safe.

**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage includes unit tests for aggregation logic, error handling, performance verification, and integration with existing repository patterns. Mock-based testing ensures isolated component validation.

**Rate Limiting Compliance**: The implementation uses a single batched query design that respects Airtable's 5 requests/second limit by minimizing API calls through efficient field selection and in-memory processing.
