# Code Review - Add Line Numbers to Exported Participant Tables

**Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Reviewer**: AI Code Reviewer  
**Task**: `tasks/task-2025-01-26-line-numbers-export/Line Numbers in Export Tables.md` | **PR**: [URL unavailable] | **Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED

## Summary
Second-pass review confirms that all previously reported regressions are fixed. Line-number utilities remain comprehensive, view-based exports now emit a single `#` header with populated data, authorization cache logic aligns with integration expectations, and export success messages display unpadded counts. Integration suites for access control and export workflows both pass locally.

## Requirements Compliance
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Line numbers appear as first column across all exports ‚Äì verified for full, role, department, Bible readers, and ROE flows (`src/services/*_export_service.py`, integration tests)
- [x] Regression-free behavior ‚Äì Dynamic role transition integration test passes with precise cache invalidation expectations (`tests/integration/test_access_control_integration.py`)
- [x] Export success message consistency ‚Äì Captions display plain participant counts without padding (`src/utils/export_utils.py`, handler integration tests)
- [x] Comprehensive utility coverage ‚Äì `src/utils/export_utils.py` with extensive unit tests ensures reusable formatting logic

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete
- [ ] None noted
