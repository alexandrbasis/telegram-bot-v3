**Date**: 2025-09-14 | **Reviewer**: AI Code Reviewer  
**Task**: `tasks/task-2025-01-12-team-list-display-update/Team List Display Update.md`  
**PR**: https://github.com/alexandrbasis/telegram-bot-v3/pull/42  
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED

## Summary
The implementation updates team and candidate list formatting to display department information while removing birth date and clothing size. The change is localized to `src/services/participant_list_service.py` and leverages existing model and field mappings. Tests (unit + integration) pass, static checks are clean, and message length handling remains intact.

## Requirements Compliance
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Include department in team/candidate list display ‚Äî Verified in `ParticipantListService._format_participant_line()` (üè¢ –û—Ç–¥–µ–ª).
- [x] Remove birth date and clothing size from list output ‚Äî Absent in new format; tests assert non-presence.
- [x] Field mappings include department ‚Äî Confirmed (`fldIh0eyPspgr1TWk`).
- [x] Proper formatting and Markdown V2 escaping ‚Äî Uses `telegram.helpers.escape_markdown(..., version=2)`.
- [x] Graceful handling of empty/missing department ‚Äî Uses placeholder "‚Äî"; tests cover.
- [x] Respect Telegram 4096-char limit ‚Äî Existing truncation logic preserved and effective.

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete
- None identified.

## Quality Assessment
**Overall**: ‚úÖ Excellent  
**Architecture**: Localized service-layer change; adheres to existing patterns  
**Standards**: Clear, readable, defensive handling for optional fields  
**Security**: Removes personal data from list views; no sensitive data exposed

## Testing & Documentation
**Testing**: ‚úÖ Adequate (unit + integration)  
**Test Execution Results**: 913 passed, 0 failed, 55 warnings; total coverage 87.08%; `src/services/participant_list_service.py` at 100% coverage.  
**Documentation**: ‚úÖ Complete ‚Äî Task document thoroughly updated.

## Issues Checklist
### üö® Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
- None.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major (Should Fix)
- None.

### üí° Minor (Nice to Fix)
- [x] Label consistency: unified list output label to "–î–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç" (was "–û—Ç–¥–µ–ª"). Tests updated accordingly. Consider centralizing labels/icons to avoid future drift.

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. Optional: Align department label/icon across modules (list, search, edit) for consistency.

### Future Improvements
1. Centralize display labels/icons for common fields (e.g., via a shared mapping) to prevent drift.

## Final Decision
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR MERGE

**Criteria**: All requirements implemented, high-quality code, comprehensive tests, and documentation complete. No regressions detected.

## Implementation Assessment
**Execution**: Focused, minimal edits in service layer; correct use of escaping and placeholders.  
**Documentation**: Task doc is detailed with clear before/after and traceability.  
**Verification**: Full test suite executed; static checks (flake8, mypy) are clean.
