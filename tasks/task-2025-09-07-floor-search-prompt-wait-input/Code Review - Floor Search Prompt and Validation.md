# Code Review - Floor Search Prompt and Validation

**Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Reviewer**: AI Code Reviewer  
**Task**: `tasks/task-2025-09-07-floor-search-prompt-wait-input/floor-search-prompt-and-validation.md` | **PR**: [URL MISSING] | **Status**: 🔄 NEEDS DISCUSSION

## Summary
Review initialization completed, but the task is not yet ready for code review. The task document is in "Ready for Implementation" status and contains no PR details (branch/URL). Per the review policy, review must stop until implementation is complete and a PR is available.

## Requirements Compliance
### ✅ Completed
- [x] Business requirements are clearly stated in the task document.
- [x] Test plan and acceptance scenarios are defined.

### ❌ Missing/Incomplete
- [ ] Implementation work not present in codebase for this task.
- [ ] PR details missing (branch and URL) for review.
- [ ] Task status not set to "Implementation Complete".

## Quality Assessment
**Overall**: 🔄 Good (for planning)  
**Architecture**: Consistent with existing bot/service/data layering  
**Standards**: Requirements and tests well-articulated  
**Security**: N/A until implementation

## Testing & Documentation
**Testing**: ❌ Insufficient (implementation not present; cannot execute tests specific to this task)  
**Test Execution Results**: Not executed for this feature; awaiting implementation/PR  
**Documentation**: ✅ Complete (task planning and acceptance criteria)

## Issues Checklist

### 🚨 Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
- [ ] Missing PR and implementation code → Blocks review → Implement per task spec, open PR, link in task document → Verify by running full test suite and feature-specific tests.

### ⚠️ Major (Should Fix)
- [ ] Update task status to "Implementation Complete" once code and tests are ready.

### 💡 Minor (Nice to Fix)
- [ ] Include explicit RU message strings in the task doc for final copy check (prompt, error, cancel messages) to simplify review.

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. Implement the floor search prompt/wait/validation flow in bot handlers and state machine.
2. Add unit/integration tests specified in the task; ensure they pass locally.
3. Open a PR, add branch and PR URL to the task document.
4. Set task status to "Implementation Complete" and request review.

### Future Improvements
1. Add telemetry counters for error rate and completion rate to track the success metrics post‑deploy.

## Final Decision
**Status**: 🔄 NEEDS DISCUSSION

**Criteria**: Review cannot proceed because implementation and PR are missing. Once provided, a full code review will be performed with test execution.

## Developer Instructions
### Fix Issues:
1. Complete implementation and open PR, then update the task document with PR details.
2. Mark task status as "Implementation Complete".
3. Run tests and ensure coverage reflects new paths.

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Complete test suite executed and passes
- [ ] Manual testing of implemented features completed
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Test results documented with actual output

### Re-Review:
1. Notify reviewer when PR is ready and task status is updated.
2. Reviewer will execute tests and produce a full review per policy.
