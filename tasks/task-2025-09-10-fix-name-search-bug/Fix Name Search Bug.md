## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)

### Business Context
Users cannot search for participants by name as the search button text is being processed as a search query instead of transitioning to the input state.

### Primary Objective
Restore name search functionality by fixing the conversation flow so clicking "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏" properly transitions to waiting for user input instead of immediately searching for "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏" as a participant name.

### Use Cases
1. **Normal Name Search Flow**
   - User clicks "üîç –ü–æ–∏—Å–∫ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤" from main menu
   - User sees search mode selection (name/room/floor)  
   - User clicks "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏"
   - System prompts "–í–≤–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∏–º—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞:"
   - User enters actual participant name (e.g., "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä")
   - System returns matching participants
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Clicking name search button should NOT trigger search, should show input prompt

2. **Consistent Button Behavior Across Search Modes**
   - Room search ("üö™ –ü–æ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–µ") correctly shows "–ü—Ä–∏—à–ª–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç—ã:" prompt
   - Floor search ("üè¢ –ü–æ —ç—Ç–∞–∂—É") correctly shows "–ü—Ä–∏—à–ª–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä —ç—Ç–∞–∂–∞ —Ü–∏—Ñ—Ä–æ–π" prompt
   - Name search ("üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏") should similarly show "–í–≤–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∏–º—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞:" prompt
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All three search modes behave consistently with prompt-then-input pattern

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Name search button correctly transitions to input waiting state
- [ ] No "–£—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –Ω–µ –Ω–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω—ã" error when clicking search mode buttons
- [ ] User can successfully search for participants by entering actual names

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing search conversation flow
- Must preserve all existing navigation options (Cancel, Main Menu, Back)
- Fix must be consistent with recent room/floor search improvements

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Timeline
1. User clicks "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏" button in search mode selection
2. System logs: "User selected name search mode"
3. System immediately logs: "User searching for: 'üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏'"
4. System returns "No participants found" for query "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏"

### Technical Root Cause
**CONFIRMED**: The bug is in `src/bot/handlers/search_conversation.py`. The `MessageHandler` filters for the `WAITING_FOR_NAME`, `WAITING_FOR_ROOM`, and `WAITING_FOR_FLOOR` states all fail to exclude the navigation button text for the search modes themselves. For example, the `WAITING_FOR_NAME` state filter is missing `NAV_SEARCH_NAME` from its exclusion pattern:

```python
# Current (broken) - line 132-134
& ~filters.Regex(
    rf"^{re.escape(NAV_MAIN_MENU)}$|^{re.escape(NAV_CANCEL)}$|^{re.escape(NAV_BACK_TO_SEARCH_MODES)}$"
)
```

This allows the button text (e.g., "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏") to slip through and be processed as a search query instead of being excluded as navigation text. This issue applies to all three search modes.

### Comparison with Similar Flows
While it was believed that room and floor search were recently fixed, analysis shows they suffer from the same underlying bug. The fix should be applied consistently across all three search modes (name, room, and floor) to ensure they all follow the correct pattern:
- Button click ‚Üí handler sends prompt ‚Üí transitions to waiting state ‚Üí processes user input

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core functionality completely broken
- **Users Affected**: All users attempting to search by name
- **Business Impact**: Users cannot find participants, defeating primary bot purpose
- **Regression Since**: Likely introduced with recent navigation changes (PRs #31-32)

## Test Plan (Gate 2 - Approval Required)
**Status**: Awaiting Test Plan Approval | **Created**: 2025-09-10

### Test Coverage Strategy
Target: 100% coverage of name search conversation flow and state transitions

### Proposed Test Categories

#### Business Logic Tests
- [ ] Test that clicking "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏" transitions to WAITING_FOR_NAME state
- [ ] Test that name search prompt "–í–≤–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∏–º—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞:" is displayed after button click
- [ ] Test that actual participant names trigger search, not navigation button text
- [ ] Test that search results are returned for valid participant names

#### State Transition Tests  
- [ ] Test SEARCH_MODE_SELECTION ‚Üí WAITING_FOR_NAME transition via name button
- [ ] Test WAITING_FOR_NAME ‚Üí SHOWING_RESULTS transition via text input
- [ ] Test that navigation buttons in WAITING_FOR_NAME state work correctly
- [ ] Test state consistency across all three search modes (name/room/floor)

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Test that button text "üë§ –ü–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏" is NOT processed as search query
- [ ] Test that empty or whitespace-only input is handled gracefully
- [ ] Test that cancel/back navigation properly resets conversation state
- [ ] Test timeout recovery from WAITING_FOR_NAME state

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete name search flow from main menu to results display
- [ ] Test switching between different search modes without state corruption
- [ ] Test that name search uses enhanced search with fuzzy matching
- [ ] Test fallback to legacy search if enhanced search unavailable

#### User Interaction Tests
- [ ] Test reply keyboard buttons trigger correct handlers
- [ ] Test that input prompt appears immediately after mode selection
- [ ] Test that results show participant selection buttons
- [ ] Test navigation consistency with room/floor search patterns

### Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- Business Requirement 1 (Normal Name Search Flow) ‚Üí Tests: State transitions, prompt display, query processing, results display
- Business Requirement 2 (Consistent Button Behavior) ‚Üí Tests: All three search modes comparison, navigation consistency

### Task Splitting Evaluation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Evaluated | **Evaluated by**: Task Splitter Agent | **Date**: 2025-09-10
**Decision**: No Split Needed
**Reasoning**: This is a surgical single-line fix with atomic business value and appropriate PR size (~50-100 lines mostly tests). All implementation steps serve the same business objective and cannot be delivered independently. Splitting would add unnecessary overhead without benefits.
