# Task: User Experience and Integration for Participant Creation
**Created**: 2025-01-16 | **Status**: Business Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Complete the participant creation user experience with comprehensive state management, error handling, success confirmation, and full integration with the existing bot conversation system.

### Use Cases
1. **State Management and Conversation Flow**
   - System manages conversation states throughout creation process
   - Proper state transitions with timeout handling (15 minutes)
   - State cleanup on completion, cancellation, or timeout
   - Integration with main conversation dispatcher without conflicts
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Conversation state machine handles all flows including error recovery and timeouts

2. **Error Handling and User Feedback**
   - Clear Russian error messages for validation failures
   - Specific missing field identification in user-friendly format
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations with data preservation
   - Technical error recovery with actionable user options
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All error scenarios handled with clear guidance and recovery options

3. **Success Confirmation and Completion**
   - Rich formatted confirmation message with participant details
   - Includes Airtable record ID for reference
   - Clear completion options (create another, return to menu)
   - Proper conversation flow return to main menu
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Success flow provides complete information and clear next steps

4. **Integration Testing and Monitoring**
   - End-to-end testing covering all user scenarios
   - Comprehensive logging of creation events for monitoring
   - Integration with existing bot patterns and infrastructure
   - Performance monitoring and error tracking
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Full test coverage with monitoring capabilities

### Success Metrics
- [ ] State management handles all conversation flows reliably
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable feedback in Russian
- [ ] Success confirmation includes all relevant participant information
- [ ] Integration testing covers 100% of user scenarios

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing conversation dispatcher patterns
- Must follow existing bot state management conventions
- Error messages must be in Russian and user-friendly
- Must not break existing conversation flows or handlers
