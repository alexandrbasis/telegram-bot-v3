# Task: File Delivery Error Handling
**Created**: 2025-01-14 | **Status**: Business Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Complete the CSV export functionality by implementing secure file delivery through Telegram with comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup.

### Use Cases
1. **File Upload to Telegram**: CSV files delivered directly to users via Telegram document upload
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Generated CSV files successfully sent to users through bot with proper document metadata

2. **Comprehensive Error Recovery**: All error scenarios handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: API failures, permission errors, file size issues, and network problems handled with clear user feedback and recovery options

3. **Resource Management**: Generated files automatically cleaned up after successful delivery
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Temporary files removed from server after upload completion to prevent disk space accumulation

### Success Metrics
- [ ] CSV files successfully delivered to users via Telegram document upload
- [ ] All error scenarios handled with appropriate user-friendly messages
- [ ] File cleanup prevents disk space accumulation
- [ ] Upload handles Telegram's file size limits appropriately
- [ ] End-to-end export workflow completes successfully from command to delivery

### Constraints
- Must handle Telegram's 50MB file size limit with appropriate user warnings
- File cleanup must occur even if upload fails to prevent resource leaks
- Error messages must be localized and user-friendly (Russian language)
- Upload must work within Telegram rate limits and API constraints
- Consider optional ZIP compression for exports exceeding file size limits
- Log all errors using existing user_interaction_logger.py for auditing
