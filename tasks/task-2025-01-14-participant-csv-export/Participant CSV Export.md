# Task: Participant CSV Export
**Created**: 2025-01-14 | **Status**: Ready for Implementation

## GATE 1: Business Requirements (MANDATORY)
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-01-14

### Business Context
Enable administrators to export complete participant datasets for external analysis, reporting, and data management purposes.

### Primary Objective
Create a CSV export function that extracts ALL participant information from Airtable in the exact same format and structure as stored in the database, providing administrators with complete data portability.

### Use Cases
1. **Administrative Reporting**: Event coordinators need to generate comprehensive participant reports for post-event analysis and record-keeping
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Export includes all participant fields (names, contact info, participation history, notes, etc.) in CSV format identical to Airtable structure

2. **Data Backup & Migration**: Administrators need to create complete data backups for disaster recovery or system migration purposes
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: CSV contains 100% of participant data with field names matching Airtable column headers exactly

3. **External Analysis**: Leadership requires participant data in spreadsheet format for external analytics tools and reporting dashboards
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: CSV is immediately usable in Excel/Google Sheets without additional formatting or data transformation

### Success Metrics
- [ ] CSV export contains 100% of participant data fields available in Airtable
- [ ] Column headers match Airtable field names exactly
- [ ] Data integrity verified - no missing or corrupted data in export
- [ ] Export completes successfully for full participant database (all records)
- [ ] File format is standard CSV compatible with Excel and other spreadsheet applications

### Constraints
- Must maintain data privacy and security during export process
- Export should handle large datasets efficiently without timeout issues
- Access should be restricted to authorized administrators only
- File should be generated server-side and made available for download
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding in CSV generation to properly handle Russian (Cyrillic) characters
- Consider streaming CSV assembly for very large datasets (&gt;10k records) to optimize memory usage

## GATE 2: Test Plan (MANDATORY)
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-01-14

### Test Coverage Strategy
Target: 90%+ coverage across all implementation areas

### Proposed Test Categories

#### Business Logic Tests
- [ ] **Full dataset export test** - Verify CSV contains all participant records from Airtable
- [ ] **Field mapping accuracy test** - Validate all Airtable fields are included with correct names
- [ ] **Data integrity test** - Confirm exported data matches source data exactly (no corruption/truncation)
- [ ] **CSV format compliance test** - Ensure output follows standard CSV specifications (RFC 4180)
- [ ] **Large dataset handling test** - Test export performance with 1000+ participant records

#### State Transition Tests
- [ ] **Export initiation flow** - Test command processing from user request to export start
- [ ] **Progress tracking state** - Verify export progress feedback during long operations
- [ ] **Completion state transition** - Test successful export completion and file availability
- [ ] **Download state management** - Test file access and cleanup after download

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] **Airtable API failure test** - Handle network errors, rate limiting, authentication failures
- [ ] **Memory exhaustion test** - Test behavior when export exceeds available memory
- [ ] **Disk space limitation test** - Handle insufficient storage for large CSV files
- [ ] **Permission denied test** - Test unauthorized access attempts to export function
- [ ] **Malformed data handling** - Test export with corrupted/incomplete Airtable records

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Airtable API integration test** - End-to-end data retrieval from real Airtable instance
- [ ] **File system integration test** - Test CSV file creation, writing, and cleanup
- [ ] **Bot command integration test** - Test export via Telegram bot command interface
- [ ] **Authentication integration test** - Verify admin-only access control works correctly

#### User Interaction Tests
- [ ] **Export command processing test** - Test `/export` or similar command recognition
- [ ] **Progress notification test** - Test user feedback during long export operations
- [ ] **File delivery test** - Test CSV file delivery to user (download link/direct send)
- [ ] **Error message formatting test** - Test user-friendly error messages for common failures
- [ ] **Success confirmation test** - Test completion notification with export statistics

### Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- **Administrative Reporting** → Tests: Full dataset export, Field mapping accuracy, CSV format compliance
- **Data Backup & Migration** → Tests: Data integrity, Large dataset handling, Airtable API integration
- **External Analysis** → Tests: CSV format compliance, Field mapping accuracy, File delivery
- **Data Privacy & Security** → Tests: Permission denied, Authentication integration
- **Performance & Reliability** → Tests: Large dataset handling, Memory exhaustion, Progress tracking

### Task Splitting Evaluation
**Status**: ✅ Evaluated | **Evaluated by**: Task Splitter Agent | **Date**: 2025-01-14
**Decision**: Split into 3 sub-tasks for better manageability and focused development
**Reasoning**: Original scope (13 sub-steps, 600-800 lines of code) exceeds standard PR limits. Splitting enables focused reviews, reduces integration risk, and allows incremental delivery.

### Constraints
- CSV export must handle large datasets (1000+ records) without memory issues
- File delivery must work within Telegram's file size limits (50MB)
- Export operation should complete within reasonable time limits to avoid user timeouts
- Generated files must be automatically cleaned up after successful delivery
- Admin access control must be properly enforced to prevent unauthorized data access
