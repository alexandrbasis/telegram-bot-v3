# Task: Integration Testing and Error Handling for Room Floor Search
**Created**: 2025-09-04 | **Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Implement comprehensive integration testing and robust error handling for the complete room and floor search functionality, ensuring production readiness and graceful failure recovery.

### Use Cases
1. **End-to-end workflow validation**: Test complete search flows from command to response
   - **Acceptance criteria**: All user journeys work correctly with real Airtable integration
   - **Technical flow**: Command → Handler → Service → Repository → Airtable → Response

2. **Error scenario handling**: Gracefully handle all failure modes
   - **Acceptance criteria**: Users receive helpful messages for all error conditions
   - **Error types**: Invalid input, API failures, network timeouts, malformed data

3. **Performance validation**: Ensure search operations meet performance targets
   - **Acceptance criteria**: All searches complete within 3 seconds
   - **Metrics**: Response time, API call efficiency, result formatting speed

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All end-to-end workflows function correctly
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Performance targets met (< 3 second response)
- [ ] 90%+ overall test coverage achieved
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Constraints
- Must validate against actual Airtable schema with correct field mappings
- Must test with realistic data volumes and edge cases
- Must ensure backward compatibility with existing search
- Must handle Airtable API rate limits gracefully

**APPROVAL GATE:** Present business section to user with: "Approve business requirements? [Yes/No]"
**After approval, update Status to: Ready for Implementation**
