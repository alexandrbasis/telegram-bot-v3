# Task: Integration Testing and Error Handling
**Created**: 2025-09-04 | **Status**: Business Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Implement comprehensive integration testing and robust error handling for the complete room and floor search functionality, ensuring production readiness and graceful failure recovery.

### Use Cases
1. **End-to-end workflow validation**: Complete user journeys work seamlessly
   - **Acceptance criteria**: All search workflows function from command to result display
   - **Coverage**: Room search, floor search, mode switching, error cases

2. **Error scenario handling**: System gracefully handles all failure modes
   - **Acceptance criteria**: User-friendly error messages for all invalid inputs
   - **Coverage**: Invalid room numbers, API failures, empty results, network timeouts

3. **Production readiness verification**: System meets all quality standards
   - **Acceptance criteria**: 90%+ test coverage, all edge cases handled
   - **Performance**: Search operations complete within SLA (3 seconds)

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Error handling covers 100% of identified failure scenarios
- [ ] No unhandled exceptions in any user flow
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds requirements

### Constraints
- Dependencies on subtask-1 and subtask-2 completion
- Must test with real Airtable API in integration environment
- Must validate Russian/English language support
- Must ensure no regression in existing functionality

**APPROVAL GATE:** Present business section to user with: "Approve business requirements? [Yes/No]"
**After approval, update Status to: Ready for Implementation**
