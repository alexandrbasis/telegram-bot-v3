Task: tasks/task-2025-09-04-room-floor-search/subtask-3-integration-testing/Integration Testing and Error Handling.md | PR: https://github.com/alexandrbasis/telegram-bot-v3/pull/21 | Status: ‚ùå NEEDS FIXES

## Summary
End-to-end integration tests for room and floor search are comprehensive and pass locally. Error handling and performance checks (<3s) look good. However, schema validation tests reveal critical wiring and mapping issues: the service factory constructs `SearchService` incorrectly, and tests expect repository `update_by_id` to accept Airtable Field IDs directly, which conflicts with the designed mapping flow (repository ‚Üí client translates to IDs). There is also a likely schema/type mismatch for `RoomNumber` in field mappings vs. alphanumeric support requirements.

## Requirements Compliance
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] End-to-end workflow tests: Room and Floor search paths covered and pass
- [x] Error scenarios: Invalid input, no results, API errors return helpful messages
- [x] Performance: Room/floor search complete under 3 seconds in tests
- [x] Alphanumeric room test coverage present and passes in formatting/sorting
- [x] 25+ integration tests added (7 room + 11 floor + 10 schema = 28 total)

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete
- [ ] Schema validation tests: 3 failures indicate wiring/mapping issues (details below)
- [ ] Field ID usage for write operations: Not validated per current repository API; tests assume different contract
- [ ] Factory wiring: `SearchService` constructed with wrong positional argument
- [ ] Potential schema mismatch: `RoomNumber` marked NUMBER, but requirements/tests expect alphanumeric

## Quality Assessment
Overall: üîÑ Good
Architecture: Clear 3-layer separation; factory wiring bug breaks runtime searches. Standards: Test structure, naming, and mocking are solid. Security: No new concerns introduced in this scope.

## Testing & Documentation
Testing: üîÑ Partial
Test Execution Results:
- tests/integration/test_room_search_integration.py ‚Üí 7 passed (0.52s)
- tests/integration/test_floor_search_integration.py ‚Üí 11 passed (0.45s)
- tests/integration/test_airtable_schema_validation.py ‚Üí 7 passed, 3 failed (0.22s)

Failures (3):
1) test_search_service_integration_with_field_ids: AttributeError 'NoneType' object has no attribute client ‚Üí Root cause: `SearchService` constructed incorrectly (positional `repository` passed into `similarity_threshold`); also reflected in `service_factory.get_search_service()`.
2) test_field_id_validation_for_write_operations: ValidationError Unknown field name: fldlzG1sVg01hsy2g ‚Üí Root cause: `update_by_id` expects model field names; tests pass Airtable Field IDs.
3) test_field_mapping_bidirectional_consistency: Same as (2).

Documentation: üîÑ Partial ‚Äî Task doc claims schema validation ‚ÄúDone‚Äù, but current tests fail; update needed after fixes.

## Issues Checklist

### üö® Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
- [ ] SearchService factory wiring incorrect: `service_factory.get_search_service()` returns `SearchService(repository)` with wrong argument order ‚Üí Breaks runtime room/floor searches (repository None inside service). Solution: `return SearchService(repository=repository)` (optionally expose thresholds via settings). Files: src/services/service_factory.py. Verification: unit/integration tests invoking handlers without patching factory should pass.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major (Should Fix)
- [ ] Test constructor misuse: `SearchService(repository)` used in tests; must be `SearchService(repository=repository)` to match signature. Files: tests/integration/test_airtable_schema_validation.py. Verification: re-run schema tests; failure (1) resolved.
- [ ] Repository update_by_id contract vs. tests: Tests pass Airtable Field IDs as keys; repository expects model fields and relies on client to translate names ‚Üí IDs. Align by changing tests to pass model fields (`{"floor": 5, "room_number": "501"}`) and keep assertion to ensure `update_record` was called. Alternatively, extend repository to accept either model names or Airtable names/IDs and normalize via `AirtableFieldMapping` before calling client. Files: tests/integration/test_airtable_schema_validation.py (preferred to fix tests); or src/data/airtable/airtable_participant_repo.py (if API broadened). Verification: re-run schema tests; failures (2) and (3) resolved.
- [ ] Field type mismatch: `AirtableFieldMapping.FIELD_TYPES` marks `RoomNumber` as NUMBER, but requirements and tests expect alphanumeric room support. Impact: Real Airtable base with numeric type cannot hold values like "A201"; filtering/sorting assumptions diverge. Solution: Confirm live schema; if alphanumeric required, set `RoomNumber` to TEXT and adjust constraints. Files: src/config/field_mappings.py. Verification: manual schema check and end-to-end search with alphanumeric room.
- [ ] Inconsistent field names in name search: `AirtableParticipantRepository.search_by_name` uses `{Full Name (RU)}` and `{Full Name (EN)}` in formula; mapping defines `FullNameRU` / `FullNameEN`. Impact: Queries will fail in production. Solution: Use mapping constants (`AirtableFieldMapping.PYTHON_TO_AIRTABLE`). Files: src/data/airtable/airtable_participant_repo.py. Verification: unit test for formula construction or integration test with mock client.

### üí° Minor (Nice to Fix)
- [ ] Factory configuration knobs: Allow thresholds and max_results via settings to avoid magic defaults in `SearchService`.
- [ ] Tests clarity: In schema tests, add comments clarifying repository-vs-client responsibilities for Field ID translation.

## Recommendations
Immediate Actions
1. Fix `get_search_service()` to pass repository via keyword arg.
2. Update schema tests to construct `SearchService(repository=...)` and use model field names for `update_by_id`.
3. Align `search_by_name` formula field names with mapping.
4. Verify and correct `RoomNumber` field type based on live Airtable schema; update mapping/tests accordingly.
5. Re-run integration tests and update the task document‚Äôs changelog and status.

Future Improvements
1. Centralize field-name usage in repository by referencing `AirtableFieldMapping` to prevent drift.
2. Add a small unit suite for `service_factory` wiring (ensures non-None repository with expected defaults).

## Final Decision
Status: ‚ùå NEEDS FIXES

Criteria: Failures in schema validation tests, a critical factory wiring bug affecting runtime, and a likely schema mismatch require fixes before merge.

## Developer Instructions
Fix Issues:
1. Apply the fixes above (factory, tests, mapping, repository formula fields).
2. Update the task document‚Äôs Testing Strategy and Changelog to reflect actual changes.
3. Run the integration tests for room/floor/schema and ensure all pass.

Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Room and floor integration tests pass (18/18)
- [ ] Schema validation tests pass (10/10)
- [ ] Manual verification of alphanumeric room behavior (if supported by schema)
- [ ] No regressions in other integration tests
- [ ] Test results documented with actual output

Re-Review:
1. After fixes, request re-review to confirm APPROVED status.

## Implementation Assessment
Execution: Followed structure well; strong tests for handlers.  
Documentation: Needs update to match actual test outcomes.  
Verification: End-to-end room/floor OK; schema tests expose gaps.
