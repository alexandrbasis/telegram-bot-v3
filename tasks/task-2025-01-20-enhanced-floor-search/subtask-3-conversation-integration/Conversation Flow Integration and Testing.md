# Task: Conversation Flow Integration and Testing
**Created**: 2025-01-20 | **Status**: Ready for Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Integrate floor discovery UI components with conversation handler registration and validate the complete user journey through comprehensive testing.

### Use Cases
1. **Seamless Conversation Flow**: Floor discovery callbacks work within existing conversation states
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: CallbackQueryHandler entries registered for "floor_discovery" and "floor_select_*" patterns in WAITING_FOR_FLOOR state
2. **Complete User Journey**: End-to-end flow from floor search to discovery to selection to results
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: User can navigate: floor search → discovery button → floor selection → participant results
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Traditional numeric floor input continues to work alongside new interactive features
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Manual floor number input processed identically to previous behavior

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Complete user journey works without state transition errors
- [ ] Callback handlers properly registered and responding in conversation flow
- [ ] Both interactive and traditional input methods function simultaneously
- [ ] Integration testing validates all error recovery scenarios

### Constraints
- Must not break existing conversation flow or state transitions
- Both callback handlers must be registered in FloorSearchStates.WAITING_FOR_FLOOR state
- Integration testing must cover both success and failure paths
- All error recovery scenarios must return users to appropriate states

**APPROVAL GATE:** Present business section to user with: "Approve business requirements? [Yes/No]"
**After approval, update Status to: Ready for Implementation**
