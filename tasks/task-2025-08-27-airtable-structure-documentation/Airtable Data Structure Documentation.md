# Task: Airtable Data Structure Documentation
**Created**: 2025-08-27 | **Status**: Business Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Document the complete Airtable data structure specifications within the main implementation tasks to ensure all developers understand exactly what data fields, types, and constraints they are implementing for the Tres Dias Telegram bot.

### Use Cases
1. **Developer Reference**: Provide immediate access to field specifications during implementation without switching between documents
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All 13 Airtable fields are clearly documented with IDs, types, and constraints
   - **Success Measure**: Developers can reference field specs without opening external files

2. **Implementation Validation**: Enable developers to verify their code matches the exact Airtable schema
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Field mappings, validation rules, and data types are explicitly defined
   - **Success Measure**: Implementation exactly matches Airtable field specifications

3. **Future Reference**: Create searchable documentation for future database modifications or migrations
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Documentation includes field IDs, types, constraints, and examples
   - **Success Measure**: Any future changes can reference complete field specifications

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All 13 Airtable fields documented with complete specifications
- [ ] Field IDs, types, constraints, and examples included for each field
- [ ] Documentation integrated into relevant implementation task documents
- [ ] Searchable field reference available for developers

### Constraints
- Must document exact field structure from existing Airtable base (appRp7Vby2JMzN0mC)
- Must include all field IDs for programmatic access
- Must specify validation rules for each field type
- Must maintain consistency with existing airtable_database_structure.md

**APPROVAL GATE:** Approve business requirements? [Yes/No]

## Business Context
[To be filled after approval: Provide comprehensive field reference for accurate implementation]

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Complete field specifications for all 13 Airtable fields
- [ ] Field ID mapping for programmatic access
- [ ] Validation rules and constraints documentation
- [ ] Data type specifications with examples
- [ ] Select field options with IDs and colors
- [ ] Integration with existing task documents

## Implementation Steps & Change Log
- [ ] Step 1: Document text fields with specifications
  - [ ] Sub-step 1.1: Document all 6 text fields with IDs, purposes, and examples
    - **Directory**: `tasks/current-implementation-tasks/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: Update existing task documents with field specs
    - **Accept**: All text fields documented with field IDs and constraints
    - **Tests**: Validation that documentation matches actual Airtable structure
    - **Done**: Text field specifications available for reference
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

- [ ] Step 2: Document single select fields with all options
  - [ ] Sub-step 2.1: Document all 5 select fields with option IDs and constraints
    - **Directory**: `tasks/current-implementation-tasks/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: Add select field specifications to task documents
    - **Accept**: All select fields documented with option IDs, colors, and validation
    - **Tests**: Verify all option IDs match Airtable configuration
    - **Done**: Select field specifications available with complete option lists
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

- [ ] Step 3: Document number and date fields
  - [ ] Sub-step 3.1: Document PaymentAmount and PaymentDate field specifications
    - **Directory**: `tasks/current-implementation-tasks/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: Add number/date field specs to task documents
    - **Accept**: Number and date fields documented with precision and format specs
    - **Tests**: Validation of number precision and date format requirements
    - **Done**: All field types documented with complete specifications
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Documentation validation: Verify all field specifications match Airtable structure
- [ ] Completeness check: Ensure all 13 fields are documented
- [ ] Reference testing: Validate field IDs and option IDs are correct
- [ ] Integration testing: Confirm documentation integrates properly with task documents

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 13 Airtable fields completely documented
- [ ] Field IDs and option IDs verified against live Airtable structure
- [ ] Documentation integrated into implementation task references
- [ ] Developers can implement without external file references
- [ ] Validation rules clearly specified for all field types
- [ ] Code review approved
