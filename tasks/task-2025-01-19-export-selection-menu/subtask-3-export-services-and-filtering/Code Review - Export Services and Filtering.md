# Code Review - Export Services and Filtering

**Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Reviewer**: AI Code Reviewer  
**Task**: `tasks/task-2025-01-19-export-selection-menu/subtask-3-export-services-and-filtering/Export Services and Filtering.md` | **PR**: https://github.com/alexandrbasis/telegram-bot-v3/pull/55 | **Status**: ‚ùå NEEDS FIXES

## Summary
Participant export filtering logic behaves as expected in isolation, and new BibleReaders/ROE export services include thorough unit coverage with end-to-end pytest passing. However, the shared service factory breaks at runtime because it calls `Settings.get_airtable_config` with a table-type argument that the method does not accept, so any attempt to resolve the new repositories/exporters will raise immediately.

## Requirements Compliance
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Role- and department-filtered participant CSV generation follows existing formatting and progress-callback patterns (`src/services/participant_export_service.py:240`).

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete
- [ ] Table-specific Airtable client wiring fails; get_airtable_client_for_table cannot obtain configuration for BibleReaders/ROE tables because `Settings.get_airtable_config` lacks the required parameter, so the new export services cannot be constructed (`src/services/service_factory.py:56`, `src/config/settings.py:504`).

## Quality Assessment
**Overall**: ‚ùå Needs Improvement  
**Architecture**: table-specific client cache is a good direction, but the settings API contract mismatch blocks the entire feature. | **Standards**: new services mirror existing export patterns and are readable. | **Security**: no new concerns observed.

## Testing & Documentation
**Testing**: üîÑ Partial  
**Test Execution Results**: `pytest -q` ‚Üí pass (272 tests, coverage >80%). Targeted test run fails the global `fail-under=80` check unless the full suite is executed.  
**Documentation**: üîÑ Partial ‚Äì task log updated, but the runtime-breaking wiring suggests a missing verification step for configuration integration.

## Issues Checklist

### üö® Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
- [ ] **Service factory calls non-existent settings overload**: `get_airtable_client_for_table` passes a `table_type` argument to `Settings.get_airtable_config`, but that method signature takes no parameters. In production this raises `TypeError: get_airtable_config() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`, preventing BibleReaders/ROE repositories or export services from ever being instantiated ‚Üí update `Settings.get_airtable_config` to accept an optional `table_type` (delegate to `DatabaseSettings.to_airtable_config(table_type)`) or adjust the factory to call `settings.database.to_airtable_config(...)` directly (`src/services/service_factory.py:56`, `src/config/settings.py:504`).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major (Should Fix)  
- [ ] _None identified_

### üí° Minor (Nice to Fix)
- [ ] _None identified_

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. Update the settings API or service factory so table-specific Airtable configs can be retrieved without raising; rerun targeted factory tests against the real settings object to cover this scenario.

### Future Improvements  
1. Consider hydrating participant metadata (church, room) in-memory to avoid per-record repository calls once the primary blocker is resolved.

## Final Decision
**Status**: ‚ùå NEEDS FIXES

## Developer Instructions
### Fix Issues:
1. Extend `Settings.get_airtable_config` (or adjust the factory call) to support table-specific configs and add regression coverage that exercises the real settings object.
2. Rerun the full pytest suite to satisfy the coverage gate and ensure the factories instantiate correctly.

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Complete test suite executed and passes
- [ ] Manual testing of implemented features completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed (if applicable)
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Test results documented with actual output

## Implementation Assessment
**Execution**: Most service-layer changes follow the plan, but runtime integration broke due to the settings mismatch.  
**Documentation**: Task notes are thorough, yet they miss the configuration caveat.  
**Verification**: Automated tests added, though they rely on mocks that concealed the factory bug.
