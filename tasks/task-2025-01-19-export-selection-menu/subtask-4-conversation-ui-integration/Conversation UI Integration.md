# Task: Conversation UI Integration
**Created**: 2025-01-19 | **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED | **Updated**: 2025-09-22

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Convert the existing `/export` command into an interactive conversation flow with a selection menu that provides 6 export options, enabling administrators to choose specific data exports rather than downloading everything.

### Use Cases
1. **Interactive Export Selection**: Admin uses `/export` command and sees menu with 6 clear options
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Command shows selection menu with options: Export All, Export Team, Export Candidates, Export by Department, Export Bible Readers, Export ROE
2. **Department Selection Workflow**: Admin selects "Export by Department" and sees list of all 13 departments
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Secondary menu shows all departments (ROE, Chapel, Setup, Palanka, Administration, Kitchen, Decoration, Bell, Refreshment, Worship, Media, Clergy, Rectorate)
3. **Export Processing Feedback**: Admin sees progress updates during export generation
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: User receives progress messages and completion notifications with file statistics
4. **Cancel and Error Handling**: Admin can cancel export process or recover from errors
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Cancel option returns to main menu, errors show helpful messages with retry options

### Success Metrics
- [x] ✅ Conversion from direct export to interactive selection improves user experience (verified through mobile-optimized keyboard layouts with Russian localization and intuitive navigation flow)
- [x] ✅ Clear progress feedback reduces user uncertainty during processing (verified through ExportProgressTracker integration with throttled updates and completion notifications)
- [x] ✅ Admin can easily access all export types through intuitive menu navigation (verified through 6 export options with clear labels and department submenu with all 13 departments)

### Constraints
- Must maintain admin-only access control throughout workflow
- Conversation flow must integrate with existing bot architecture
- Must preserve backwards compatibility for admin users
- UI must support Russian language for user-facing elements

**APPROVAL GATE:** Present business section to user with: "Approve business requirements? [Yes/No]"
**After approval, update Status to: Ready for Implementation**
