**Task**: `tasks/task-2025-01-19-department-filter-list/subtask-1-foundation-model-keyboard/Foundation - Model Extensions and Department Selection UI.md` | **PR**: https://github.com/alexandrbasis/telegram-bot-v3/pull/49 | **Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED

## Summary
Implementation extends the `Participant` model with optional chief flag and wires Airtable mappings plus a new department filter keyboard with Russian labels. Behaviour and serialization look correct, docstring now accurately reflects the keyboard layout, and unit coverage for both model and keyboard is strong.

## Requirements Compliance
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Participant model exposes `is_department_chief` with Airtable serialization/deserialization and mapping entries; backwards compatibility maintained.
- [x] Department filter keyboard surfaces 13 departments plus ‚Äú–í—Å–µ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏‚Äù and ‚Äú–ë–µ–∑ –¥–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞‚Äù with consistent callback patterns and Russian translations.

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete
- [ ] None

## Quality Assessment
**Overall**: üîÑ Good  
**Architecture**: Aligns with existing model/keyboard patterns; optional boolean avoids breaking consumers. | **Standards**: Code style and tests consistent with repo conventions. | **Security**: No sensitive data or auth concerns introduced.

## Testing & Documentation
**Testing**: ‚úÖ Adequate  
**Test Execution Results**: `./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_models/test_participant.py::TestParticipantDepartmentChiefField --no-cov -q` ‚Üí 6 passed; `./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_bot_keyboards/test_list_keyboards.py::TestDepartmentFilterKeyboard --no-cov -q` ‚Üí 9 passed.  
**Documentation**: ‚úÖ Complete (docstring updated to match produced layout).

## Issues Checklist

### üö® Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
- [ ] None

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major (Should Fix)  
- [ ] None

### üí° Minor (Nice to Fix)
- [x] **Keyboard docstring layout mismatch**: Docstring in `src/bot/keyboards/list_keyboards.py:68` promised a ‚Äú3x5 layout (15 buttons total)‚Äù but the keyboard renders as seven rows (single-button special rows + 3-column department rows). ‚Üí Keeps documentation accurate ‚Üí Resolved by revising docstring to describe the actual button arrangement in `src/bot/keyboards/list_keyboards.py`.

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. None.

### Future Improvements  
1. Consider adding integration coverage once handler wiring is implemented to guard callback expectations end-to-end.

## Final Decision
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR MERGE
