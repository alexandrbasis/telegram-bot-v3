- Error handling tests cover edge cases including negative amounts
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality with Airtable

### Test Scenarios Covered
- Payment amount validation (negative, zero, positive values)
- Automatic status assignment when amount ≥ 1
- Payment date auto-assignment to current date
- Icon display verification in keyboard generation
- Field exclusion from editing interface

## Success Criteria
**Quality**: ✅ Excellent - Clear, measurable, and aligned with implementation  
**Coverage**: All key aspects addressed including automation rules and UI improvements

## Technical Approach  
**Soundness**: ✅ Solid - Clear implementation path with defined business rules  
**Debt Risk**: Low - Changes are localized and follow existing patterns

### Implementation Path
1. Create FIELD_ICONS constant dictionary in edit_keyboards.py with provided mapping
2. Update create_participant_edit_keyboard to use icon mapping and exclude payment fields
3. Implement payment automation in participant_update_service.py with amount ≥ 1 rule
4. Add logging for automatic payment status changes
5. Update tests to verify new behavior

### Code Quality Considerations
- Icons are already used in display (verified in edit_participant_handlers.py:126-140)
- Payment validation exists and can be extended (participant_update_service.py:79-91)
- Keyboard generation is modular and easy to update (edit_keyboards.py:14-69)
- Test structure follows established patterns

## Recommendations

### 💡 Nice to Have (Minor)
1. **Validation Enhancement** - Consider adding upper limit validation for payment amounts
2. **Audit Trail** - Add detailed logging showing old → new values for payment changes
3. **Icon Fallback** - Consider fallback to pencil icon if field icon not found (defensive programming)

## Decision Criteria

**✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: Critical issues resolved, clear technical requirements aligned with business approval, excellent step decomposition, comprehensive testing strategy, practical risk mitigation, measurable success criteria. Ready for `si` or `ci` command.

**❌ NEEDS MAJOR REVISIONS**: Critical technical gaps, unclear implementation steps, missing file paths, inadequate testing strategy, unrealistic technical approach. Requires significant updates before implementation.

       'size': '👕',
       'role': '👥',
       'department': '📋',
       'payment_amount': '💵'
   }
   ```

2. **Payment Automation** (Step 2.1):
   ```python
   if field_name == 'payment_amount' and amount >= 1:
       participant.payment_status = PaymentStatus.PAID
       participant.payment_date = date.today()
       logger.info(f"Auto-set payment status to PAID for amount {amount}")
   ```

### Implementation Readiness:
- **✅ APPROVED**: Ready for task splitter evaluation
- **Next Command**: Run task splitter to determine if task needs subdivision
