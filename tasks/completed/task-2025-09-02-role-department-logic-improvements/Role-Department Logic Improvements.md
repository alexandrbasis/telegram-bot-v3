# Task: Role-Department Logic Improvements
**Created**: 2025-09-02 | **Status**: Ready for Review

Implementation Branch: feature/task-2025-09-02-role-department-logic-improvements

Started: 2025-09-02

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)

### Primary Objective
Implement automatic department management logic when participant roles are changed during editing to ensure data consistency and improve user experience by eliminating invalid role-department combinations.

### Use Cases
1. **Auto-cleanup on Role Downgrade During Editing Process**: When a user changes a participant's role from "team member" to "candidate" during the interactive editing workflow, the system should automatically clear the department field because candidates cannot have department assignments.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Department field is automatically set to null/empty when role changes from team member to candidate during editing
   - **User Feedback**: System shows confirmation that department was cleared due to role change within the editing interface
   - **Context**: This occurs within the existing participant editing conversation flow

2. **Prompt for Department on Role Upgrade During Editing Process**: When a user changes a participant's role from "candidate" to "team member" during the interactive editing workflow, the system should prompt the user to select a department since team members require department assignments.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Department selection interface appears immediately after role change from candidate to team member during editing
   - **User Feedback**: Clear indication that department selection is required for team members within the editing flow
   - **Validation**: Cannot proceed with editing workflow without selecting a valid department
   - **Context**: This integrates with the existing editing conversation state management

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero invalid role-department combinations in the database after implementation
- [ ] Improved user experience with guided department selection workflow
- [ ] Reduced data entry errors related to role-department mismatches

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing participant data
- Changes should integrate seamlessly with current editing workflow
- Should not disrupt existing save/cancel functionality
- Must work within Telegram bot interface limitations

**APPROVAL GATE:** ✅ **APPROVED** - Ready for Test Plan

## Test Plan (Gate 2 - Approval Required)

### Test Coverage Strategy
Target: 90%+ coverage across all implementation areas

### Proposed Test Categories

#### Business Logic Tests
- [ ] **Role Change Auto-cleanup Test**: Verify department field is automatically cleared when role changes from team member to candidate during editing
  - Test data: Participant with role="team member" and department="Operations"
  - Action: Change role to "candidate" during editing flow
  - Expected: Department field becomes null/empty, confirmation message shown
  
- [ ] **Role Change Department Prompt Test**: Verify department selection prompt appears when role changes from candidate to team member during editing  
  - Test data: Participant with role="candidate" and department=null
  - Action: Change role to "team member" during editing flow
  - Expected: Department selection interface appears, cannot proceed without selection

- [ ] **Department Validation Test**: Verify only valid departments can be selected for team members
  - Test data: Available departments list from configuration
  - Action: Attempt to select valid and invalid departments
  - Expected: Only valid departments accepted, appropriate error messages for invalid selections

#### State Transition Tests
- [ ] **Editing Flow State Management Test**: Verify conversation state is properly maintained through role-department logic changes
  - Test transitions: editing → role change → department prompt → selection → save confirmation
  - Expected: All state transitions work correctly, user can navigate back/cancel at any point

- [ ] **Save/Cancel Workflow Integration Test**: Verify role-department changes integrate with existing save/cancel workflow
  - Test scenarios: Save changes with auto-cleanup, cancel after department prompt, retry after failed save
  - Expected: All workflows maintain data consistency and user experience

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] **Department API Failure Test**: Handle failures when fetching available departments for selection
  - Simulate: Airtable API failure during department list retrieval
  - Expected: Graceful error handling, option to retry or continue without department change

- [ ] **Invalid Role Transition Test**: Handle edge cases in role transitions
  - Test data: Participants with invalid initial states, corrupted role data
  - Expected: System handles gracefully, provides clear error messages

- [ ] **Concurrent Edit Prevention Test**: Prevent data corruption from simultaneous edits
  - Simulate: Multiple edit sessions on same participant
  - Expected: Appropriate locking or conflict resolution

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Airtable Department Field Update Test**: Verify department field updates are properly saved to Airtable
  - Test both auto-cleanup (null) and user-selected department values
  - Expected: Airtable records reflect correct department values after save

- [ ] **Field Mapping Integration Test**: Verify role and department field mappings work correctly
  - Test with actual Airtable field IDs from field_mappings.py
  - Expected: Correct fields updated in Airtable with proper data types

#### User Interaction Tests
- [ ] **Role Selection Interface Test**: Verify role change interface in editing workflow
  - Test UI elements: role selection buttons, confirmation dialogs, progress indicators
  - Expected: Intuitive interface, clear feedback, proper navigation

- [ ] **Department Selection Interface Test**: Verify department selection interface appears and functions correctly
  - Test UI elements: department list, selection buttons, required field indicators
  - Expected: All departments displayed, selection works, validation messages clear

- [ ] **Confirmation Message Test**: Verify appropriate feedback messages are shown
  - Test messages for: auto-cleanup confirmation, department selection requirement, validation errors
  - Expected: Messages are clear, informative, and contextually appropriate

### Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- **Business Requirement 1** (Auto-cleanup on Role Downgrade) → Tests: Role Change Auto-cleanup Test, Airtable Department Field Update Test, Confirmation Message Test
- **Business Requirement 2** (Prompt for Department on Role Upgrade) → Tests: Role Change Department Prompt Test, Department Validation Test, Department Selection Interface Test, Save/Cancel Workflow Integration Test

**APPROVAL GATE:** ✅ **APPROVED** - Ready for Technical Implementation
