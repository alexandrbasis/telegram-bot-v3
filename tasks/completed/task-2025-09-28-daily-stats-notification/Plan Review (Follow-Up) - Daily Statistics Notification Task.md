## Recommendations

### ðŸ’¡ Nice to Have (Minor)
1. **Clarify Persistence Storage** - Specify if using SQLite, JSON file, or Airtable for job state
2. **Define Rate Limits** - Add specific requests/second values for Airtable batching
3. **Detail Message Format** - Include example Russian notification template
4. **Add Metrics** - Consider tracking notification success/failure rates

## Decision Criteria

**âœ… APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: All critical issues have been resolved. The plan now features proper JobQueue integration, concrete implementation details with specific file paths, comprehensive testing strategy including real functional validation, practical risk mitigation, and measurable success criteria. Ready for `si` or `ci` command.
