- **PR URL**: [Will be added during implementation]
- **Status**: [Draft/Review/Merged]

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-09-07

### Business Context
Implement comprehensive CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline to complement the existing CD pipeline, ensuring code quality, security, and reliability before deployment to production.

### Primary Objective
Establish automated quality gates that prevent broken, insecure, or low-quality code from reaching the main branch and production environment, while maintaining developer productivity.

### Use Cases
1. **Pre-merge Quality Validation**: When developers create PRs, CI automatically runs comprehensive checks (tests, linting, type checking, security scans) and blocks merge if any fail
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: PR cannot be merged if CI checks fail; clear feedback provided to developers about specific failures

2. **Code Quality Enforcement**: Maintain consistent code standards across the team with automated formatting and linting checks
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All code follows project style guides; formatting issues are automatically detected and reported

3. **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Identify security issues in dependencies and code before they reach production
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Known vulnerabilities in dependencies are flagged; basic security anti-patterns are detected

4. **Test Coverage Assurance**: Ensure adequate test coverage is maintained as new features are added
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Test coverage reports are generated; coverage thresholds are enforced

5. **Build Verification**: Verify that the application builds successfully across different scenarios
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Docker builds succeed; all import statements resolve correctly

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero broken deployments due to basic code quality issues
- [ ] 100% of PRs automatically tested before merge
- [ ] Test coverage visibility and enforcement at target levels
- [ ] Security vulnerability detection rate improvement
- [ ] Developer feedback loop time under 10 minutes for CI checks

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing GitHub repository and Railway CD pipeline
- Should not significantly slow down development workflow
- Must be cost-effective (prefer GitHub Actions free tier)
- Should complement, not replace, existing local development checks
- Must handle both Python testing and Docker build verification

## Test Plan (Gate 2 - Approval Required)
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-09-07

### Task Splitting Evaluation
**Status**: ✅ Evaluated | **Evaluated by**: Task Splitter Agent | **Date**: 2025-09-07
**Decision**: No Split Needed
**Reasoning**: Task represents single atomic feature (complete CI pipeline), manageable PR size (~400 lines), sequential dependencies require complete implementation, and splitting would create non-functional intermediate states

### Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Railway CD pipeline
- Cannot modify existing local development workflow commands
- Must complete within GitHub Actions free tier limits (2000 minutes/month)
- Should leverage existing project configuration files where possible
