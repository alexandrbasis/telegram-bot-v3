# Task: Persistent File Logging System
**Created**: 2025-08-30 | **Status**: Ready for Review | **Started**: 2025-08-31 | **Completed**: 2025-08-31

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)

### Primary Objective
Implement persistent file-based logging with a dedicated log folder structure to complement the existing user interaction logging system, enabling long-term storage, analysis, and debugging of application and user interaction logs.

### Use Cases
1. **Long-term Log Storage and Analysis**: Store application logs and user interaction logs persistently for historical analysis and debugging
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All logs (application, user interactions, errors) are automatically saved to organized log files with timestamps
   
2. **Production Debugging and Monitoring**: Enable debugging of production issues by reviewing historical log files without relying on console output
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Log files are accessible, searchable, and contain sufficient detail to trace user interactions and system behavior
   
3. **Log File Management and Rotation**: Prevent disk space issues through automatic log rotation and archival
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Log files automatically rotate when they reach size limits, with configurable retention policies

4. **Development and Testing Log Review**: Provide developers with easy access to structured log files during development and testing
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Log files are organized by type (application, user interactions, errors) and easily accessible in a standard location

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of application logs are persistently stored in organized log files
- [ ] User interaction logs from the existing logging system are saved to dedicated files
- [ ] Log files are automatically rotated and managed to prevent disk space issues
- [ ] Logs are easily accessible and searchable for debugging purposes
- [ ] Zero performance impact on bot operations from file logging

### Constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing user interaction logging system
- Log files must be excluded from version control (.gitignore)
- Must not impact bot performance or user experience
- Log folder structure must follow Python/application logging best practices
- Must be configurable (enable/disable file logging via environment variables)
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing console logging
