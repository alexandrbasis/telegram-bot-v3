Task: `tasks/task-2025-09-05-replace-run-in-executor-with-asyncio-to-thread/Replace run_in_executor with asyncio.to_thread.md`  
PR: https://github.com/alexandrbasis/telegram-bot-v3/pull/25  
Status: ✅ APPROVED

## Summary
Verified repository already standardized on `asyncio.to_thread` for blocking Airtable SDK calls. No `run_in_executor` usages found in `src/`. Airtable client (`src/data/airtable/airtable_client.py`) consistently uses `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` while preserving logging, rate limiting, and error handling. Targeted unit tests pass; no behavior changes introduced or required.

## Requirements Compliance
### ✅ Completed
- [x] Replace `run_in_executor` with `asyncio.to_thread` at blocking Airtable call sites — already implemented across the client
- [x] Preserve logging, error wrapping, and rate limiting semantics — confirmed unchanged
- [x] Maintain type correctness and code quality — no new mypy/flake8 issues observed in scope
- [x] No API/signature changes — public methods unchanged

## Quality Assessment
Overall: ✅ Excellent  
Architecture: Consistent with 3-layer design; data layer encapsulates offloading and rate limiting  
Standards: Clear logging, type hints present, readable structure  
Security: No new risks; no sensitive data exposure

## Testing & Documentation
Testing: ✅ Adequate  
Test Execution Results:
- Command: `./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_data/test_airtable/test_airtable_client.py -q`
- Result: 44 passed in 0.69s (local run)
- Static check: `rg -n "run_in_executor\(" src` → 0 matches

Documentation: ✅ Complete — Task document accurately reflects a verification-only change; repository already conformed to desired pattern.

## Issues Checklist
### 🚨 Critical
- None

### ⚠️ Major
- None

### 💡 Minor
- None

## Recommendations
Immediate Actions:
- Merge as-is; no code changes required.

Future Improvements:
- Consider a brief dev note in docs summarizing the rationale for using `asyncio.to_thread` to guide future contributions.

## Final Decision
Status: ✅ APPROVED FOR MERGE  
Criteria: Requirements verified, tests pass for the affected component, no behavior or API changes, no quality issues.
