# Task: Security Audit and Testing
**Created**: 2025-09-24 | **Status**: Business Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Implement comprehensive security audit logging and end-to-end testing to ensure complete authorization coverage, Airtable sync observability, performance requirements, and security monitoring capabilities

### Use Cases
1. **Security Audit Trail**
   - Scenario: Security team needs to monitor and investigate access attempts and authorization sync events
   - Acceptance Criteria:
    - [ ] All authorization attempts logged with user ID, timestamp, action, result, cache state (cache hit/miss or Airtable fetch), and Airtable record metadata (`TelegramUserId`, `Status`, `AccessLevel`)
    - [ ] Authorization sync cycles logged with duration, record counts, and error details (including failed record IDs when applicable)
     - [ ] Failed access attempts clearly marked for investigation
     - [ ] Audit logs accessible for security review
     - [ ] Log retention and rotation properly configured

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Scenario: Bot must maintain responsive performance with authorization checks and periodic Airtable syncs
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Authorization checks complete in <100ms (cache hit) and <300ms including sync edge cases
     - [ ] No noticeable delay for authorized users during scheduled cache refresh
     - [ ] Performance benchmarks documented for cache hit, cache miss, and manual refresh flows
     - [ ] Optimization implemented where needed

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of access attempts and sync cycles captured in audit logs
- [ ] Authorization performance <100ms at 95th percentile (cache hit) and <300ms at 99th percentile including sync refresh
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for security components and sync logic
- [ ] Zero security bypasses in testing

### Constraints
- Depends on subtask-1 and subtask-2 being deployed
- Must not impact bot performance significantly
- Audit logs must comply with data retention policies
- Testing must cover all edge cases and attack vectors

## Business Context
[One-line user value statement after approval]

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create security audit logging service
- [ ] Integrate audit logging into all authorization points
- [ ] Optimize authorization performance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive integration testing
- [ ] Document security implementation
- [ ] Validate against security requirements

## Implementation Steps & Change Log
- [ ] Step 1: Create Security Audit and Sync Telemetry Service
  - [ ] Sub-step 1.1: Implement audit logging service
    - **Directory**: `src/services/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: `src/services/security_audit_service.py` (new file)
    - **Accept**: Service logs all security events with required fields, provides helpers for authorization sync metrics
    - **Tests**: `tests/unit/test_services/test_security_audit_service.py`
    - **Done**: Audit service operational with proper formatting and sync telemetry support
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

- [ ] Step 2: Integrate Audit Logging
  - [ ] Sub-step 2.1: Add logging to authorization utilities and cache
    - **Directory**: `src/utils/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: `src/utils/auth_utils.py`, `src/utils/access_control.py`, `src/utils/auth_cache.py`
    - **Accept**: All auth checks trigger audit logs; cache refresh records include sync metadata
    - **Tests**: Verify logging in existing auth and cache tests
    - **Done**: Complete audit trail for access attempts and cache refresh cycles
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

  - [ ] Sub-step 2.2: Add logging to handler authorization
    - **Directory**: `src/bot/handlers/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: All secured handler files
    - **Accept**: Handler-level auth attempts logged
    - **Tests**: Handler tests verify audit logging
    - **Done**: Handler access fully audited
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

- [ ] Step 3: Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Sub-step 3.1: Implement authorization caching and sync TTL
    - **Directory**: `src/utils/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: `src/utils/auth_utils.py`, `src/utils/auth_cache.py`
    - **Accept**: Authorization checks use efficient caching with <60s TTL refresh and manual invalidation endpoint
    - **Tests**: `tests/unit/test_utils/test_auth_performance.py` (new file)
    - **Done**: Sub-100ms performance achieved for cache hits, measured 95th/99th percentile benchmarks recorded
    - **Changelog**: [Record changes made with file paths and line ranges]

- [ ] Step 4: Comprehensive Integration Testing
  - [ ] Sub-step 4.1: Create end-to-end security tests

- [ ] Step 5: Documentation and Validation
  - [ ] Sub-step 5.1: Document security implementation
    - **Directory**: `docs/security/`
    - **Files to create/modify**: `docs/security/access_control.md` (new file)
    - **Accept**: Complete security model documented
    - **Tests**: Documentation review

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests: Audit service functionality
- [ ] Performance tests: Authorization benchmarking (cache hits/misses, sync latency)
- [ ] Integration tests: End-to-end security flows including Airtable sync updates and manual refresh
- [ ] Security tests: Attack vector validation, cache poisoning attempts, sync tampering
- [ ] Load tests: Performance under concurrent access during cache refresh cycles
- [ ] Chaos tests: Simulate Airtable outages, latency spikes, and partial data responses

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All authorization attempts and sync cycles logged with structured context
- [ ] Performance requirements met (<100ms cache hit / <300ms with sync)
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage achieved across auth cache, handlers, and audit logging
- [ ] No security bypasses found
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed, including runbook for Airtable sync operations
- [ ] Audit trail functional and accessible with retention policy defined
- [ ] Chaos testing confirms graceful degradation during Airtable outages
