    - [ ] All authorization attempts logged with user ID, timestamp, action, result, cache state (cache hit/miss or Airtable fetch), and Airtable record metadata (`TelegramUserId`, `Status`, `AccessLevel`)
    - [ ] Authorization sync cycles logged with duration, record counts, and error details (including failed record IDs when applicable)
     - [ ] Failed access attempts clearly marked for investigation
     - [ ] Audit logs accessible for security review
     - [ ] Log retention and rotation properly configured

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Scenario: Bot must maintain responsive performance with authorization checks and periodic Airtable syncs
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Authorization checks complete in <100ms (cache hit) and <300ms including sync edge cases
     - [ ] No noticeable delay for authorized users during scheduled cache refresh
     - [ ] Performance benchmarks documented for cache hit, cache miss, and manual refresh flows
     - [ ] Optimization implemented where needed

### Success Metrics
- [x] ✅ 100% of access attempts and sync cycles captured in audit logs

- [x] ✅ 95%+ test coverage for security components and sync logic
- [ ] Zero security bypasses in testing

### Constraints
- Depends on subtask-1 and subtask-2 being deployed

### What Needs to be Done (Steps 4-5)

#### 🔄 Step 4: Comprehensive Integration Testing (NEXT PRIORITY)
**Estimated**: 4-6 hours for experienced developer

##### Sub-step 4.1: End-to-End Security Tests
```bash
# File to create: tests/integration/test_access_control_integration.py
```
**Requirements**:
- Test all user roles (admin/coordinator/viewer) across complete workflows
- Validate dynamic Airtable updates reflected without restart
- Test authorization decorators in real handler contexts
- Verify audit logging captures all security events
- Test cache invalidation and refresh cycles

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Role Transition Testing**: User role changes in Airtable → Cache refresh → Access validation
2. **Handler Integration**: All secured handlers properly enforce role requirements
3. **Audit Trail Validation**: Every authorization attempt properly logged with context
4. **Cache Performance**: Real-world cache behavior under various loads
5. **Error Recovery**: System behavior during Airtable outages and timeouts

##### Sub-step 4.2: Security Penetration Testing
```bash
# File to create: tests/integration/test_security_bypass_attempts.py
```
**Requirements**:
- Test bypass attempts for each role level
- Injection attacks (SQL/NoSQL if applicable)
- Timing attacks on cache refresh
- Cache desynchronization attempts
- Session hijacking simulation
- Invalid token handling

**Attack Vectors to Test**:
1. **Authorization Bypass**: Attempts to access higher-privilege functions
2. **Cache Poisoning**: Malicious cache entries or timing attacks
3. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent role changes during authorization
4. **Input Validation**: Malformed user IDs and role data
5. **Audit Log Tampering**: Attempts to bypass or corrupt audit logs

#### 🔄 Step 5: Documentation and Validation (FINAL STEP)
**Estimated**: 2-3 hours

##### Sub-step 5.1: Security Documentation
```bash
# File to create: docs/security/access_control.md
```
**Content Required**:
- Complete security model overview
- Role hierarchy and access patterns
- Cache configuration and TTL settings
- Performance benchmarks and thresholds
- Audit log structure and retention
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Troubleshooting runbook

### Development Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+ with virtual environment
- All dependencies installed via `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`
- Existing authorization system (subtasks 1-2 deployed)

#### Key Commands
```bash
# Run audit service tests
./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_services/test_security_audit_service.py -v

# Run performance benchmarks
./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_utils/test_auth_performance.py -v

# Run all auth-related tests
./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_utils/test_auth_utils.py tests/integration/test_handler_role_enforcement.py -v

# Check code quality
./venv/bin/mypy src --no-error-summary
./venv/bin/flake8 src tests
```

### Code Architecture (For Integration Tests)

#### Security Audit Service Usage
```python
from src.services.security_audit_service import get_security_audit_service

audit_service = get_security_audit_service()

# Log authorization event
auth_event = audit_service.create_authorization_event(
    user_id=123456,
    action="handler_access:search_participant",
    result="granted",
    user_role="admin",
    cache_state="hit"
)
audit_service.log_authorization_event(auth_event)
```

#### Performance Cache Usage
```python
from src.utils.auth_cache import get_authorization_cache

cache = get_authorization_cache()
role, cache_state = cache.get(user_id)  # Returns (role, "hit"/"miss"/"expired")
cache.set(user_id, "admin")            # Cache role
cache.invalidate(user_id)               # Invalidate specific user
stats = cache.get_stats()               # Performance statistics
```

#### Access Control Testing
```python
from src.utils.access_control import require_role

@require_role("admin")
async def admin_handler(update, context):
    # Handler automatically audited via decorator
    pass
```

### Integration Test Patterns

#### Mock Setup for Integration Tests
```python
# Use existing patterns from tests/integration/test_handler_role_enforcement.py
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock, patch
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def mock_update_admin():
    """Create mock update with admin user."""
    update = MagicMock()
    update.effective_user.id = 123456  # Must match admin_user_ids
    return update
```

#### Performance Validation in Integration Tests
```python
import time

def test_end_to_end_performance():
    """Test complete authorization flow performance."""
    start_time = time.perf_counter()

    # Execute complete flow: handler → decorator → auth_utils → cache
    result = await test_handler_with_auth(update, context)

    duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start_time) * 1000
    assert duration_ms < 100  # Must meet performance requirement
```

### Potential Issues & Solutions

#### Known Challenges
1. **Airtable API Mocking**: Use existing patterns from `tests/integration/test_handler_role_enforcement.py`
2. **Async Handler Testing**: Use `pytest-asyncio` patterns already established
3. **Cache State Validation**: Check audit logs for correct cache_state values
4. **Performance Consistency**: Run benchmarks multiple times, use percentiles

#### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check audit logs in real-time (if logging configured)
tail -f logs/security_audit.log | grep "SECURITY_AUDIT"

# Performance monitoring
./venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_utils/test_auth_performance.py::TestAuthorizationPerformanceBenchmarks::test_cache_hit_performance_under_100ms_95th_percentile -v -s
```
