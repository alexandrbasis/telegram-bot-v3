**Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Reviewer**: AI Plan Reviewer  
**Task**: `tasks/task-2025-09-10-participant-demographic-fields-editing` | **Linear**: Not provided | **Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**RE-REVIEW UPDATE**: All critical issues from previous review have been addressed. Implementation steps now include proper validation methods, field classification, and display function updates.

## Summary

This plan successfully integrates recently implemented DateOfBirth and Age fields into the bot's user interface for participant editing. All critical technical implementation gaps from the previous review have been resolved, and the task is now ready for development with comprehensive validation logic, display updates, and proper field classification.

## Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Complete data model integration**: DateOfBirth and Age fields are already implemented in the Participant model with proper Pydantic validation
- **Comprehensive field mapping**: Fields are properly mapped in field_mappings.py with correct Airtable field IDs and constraints
- **Robust test strategy**: 90%+ coverage target with specific test categories for business logic, state transitions, and error handling
- **Russian language consistency**: All prompts and error messages follow established Russian interface patterns
- **Backward compatibility planning**: Proper handling of participants without demographic data

### üö® Reality Check Issues
- **Real functionality delivery**: ‚úÖ This implements genuine user-facing functionality for viewing and editing demographic fields, not just mockups
- **Meaningful business value**: ‚úÖ Provides actual demographic data management capabilities for event organizers
- **Complete implementation scope**: ‚úÖ Covers full workflow from display to editing to validation with proper error handling

### ‚úÖ Previously Critical Issues - NOW RESOLVED
- **‚úÖ Validation methods added**: Steps 3.1-3.3 now properly add date_of_birth and age to SPECIAL_FIELDS classification and implement dedicated validation methods
- **‚úÖ Field classifications completed**: Step 3.1 explicitly adds demographic fields to SPECIAL_FIELDS list with clear acceptance criteria
- **‚úÖ Display function updates included**: Steps 2.1-2.2 comprehensively update both format_participant_result() and format_participant_full() functions
- **‚úÖ Reconstruction logic completed**: Step 5.2 explicitly updates display_updated_participant() to include demographic fields in participant reconstruction

### ‚úÖ Previous Clarifications - RESOLVED
- **‚úÖ Icon selection updated**: Task now uses üéÇ for DateOfBirth and üî¢ for Age (improved from üìÖ in step 1.1) for better visual distinction
- **‚úÖ Age range confirmed**: 0-120 range is appropriate for event management - covers all realistic participant ages
- **‚úÖ Date format specified**: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) is standard and consistent with existing payment_date field handling
