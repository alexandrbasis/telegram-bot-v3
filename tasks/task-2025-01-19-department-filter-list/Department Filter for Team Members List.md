## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
**Status**: Awaiting Business Approval | **Created**: 2025-01-19

### Business Context
Enable users to filter team member lists by department for more efficient navigation and targeted participant viewing.

### Primary Objective
Add department-based filtering capability to the team members list interface, allowing users to view all members, specific department members, or unassigned members.

### Use Cases
1. **View all team members**: User selects "Team members" and chooses to see the complete list
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - User can access full team member list with existing pagination
     - Maintains current numbered list format
     - Shows total count of all team members
     - List is sorted with department chiefs first, then by church name

2. **View department-specific members**: User filters by a specific department (e.g., Worship team)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - User can select from 13 available departments
     - List displays only members assigned to selected department
     - Department chief (IsDepartmentChief = true) appears at the top of the list
     - Remaining members are sorted alphabetically by church name
     - Shows department name in the list header with chief indicator if applicable
     - Displays count specific to that department

3. **View unassigned members**: User views team members not yet assigned to any department
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - User can select "No Department" option
     - List shows only members with null/empty department field
     - Members are sorted alphabetically by church name
     - Header clearly indicates "Unassigned Members"
     - Shows count of unassigned members

4. **Sorted list display**: All filtered lists maintain consistent sorting rules
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Department chiefs (IsDepartmentChief field = true) always appear first
     - Chief is clearly marked with a special indicator (e.g., "‚≠ê Chief" or "üëë")
     - After chiefs, all other members sorted alphabetically by Church field
     - Null/empty church values appear at the end of the list
     - Sorting is case-insensitive for church names

### UI Workflow
1. User clicks "–ü–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫" (Get list) button from main menu
2. User sees two options:
   - "–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞" (Team members)
   - "–ö–∞–Ω–¥–∏–¥–∞—Ç—ã" (Candidates)
3. **NEW**: When user selects "–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞" (Team members):
   - Instead of immediately showing the list
   - Display department filter options:
    - "–í—Å–µ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏" (All participants) - shows complete list
    - Individual department buttons (13 departments)
    - "–ë–µ–∑ –¥–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞" (No department) - shows unassigned members
    - All together this keyboard exposes 15 options (13 departments + 2 special entries)
4. After department selection, display filtered list with pagination

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Users can filter team members by any of the 13 departments
- [ ] Filtering reduces time to find specific team groups by 70%
- [ ] Unassigned members are easily identifiable for department allocation
- [ ] Navigation remains intuitive with clear back/forward options

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing list display format
- Department enum values are predefined (13 departments)
- Pagination logic must work correctly with filtered results
- Russian language interface must be maintained
