# Task: Handler Integration and Complete User Workflow
**Created**: 2025-01-19 | **Status**: Ready for Review

## Business Requirements (Gate 1 - Approval Required)
### Primary Objective
Complete the department filtering feature by integrating UI components with data services and implementing the full user workflow from team selection to filtered list display.

### Use Cases
1. **Department selection workflow**: Users navigate from team selection to department filtering to filtered results
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - User selects "Team members" and sees department selection keyboard
     - Department selection leads to filtered participant list
     - Navigation preserves filter context through pagination
     - Back navigation returns to department selection, not role selection
     - Clear visual indication of active filter in list header

2. **Complete filtering experience**: All filter options work correctly with proper list display
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - "All participants" shows complete team member list with chief-first sorting
     - Individual department filters show only relevant members
     - "No department" shows only unassigned participants
     - Department chiefs marked with crown emoji in all lists
     - List headers show current filter and member counts
     - Pagination works correctly with filtered results

3. **Error handling and edge cases**: System handles exceptional scenarios gracefully
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Empty departments show appropriate "no members" message
     - Invalid department callbacks handled without crashes
     - Airtable API failures show user-friendly error messages
     - Navigation state preserved during error recovery
     - Timeout handling maintains conversation context

### Success Metrics
- [x] ✅ Complete user workflow from selection to filtered results works smoothly
- [x] ✅ All 15 filter options (13 departments + "Все участники" + "Без департамента") function correctly
- [x] ✅ Navigation preserves context and provides intuitive back/forward flow
- [x] ✅ Error scenarios handled gracefully without conversation interruption

### Constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing conversation flow
- Russian language interface maintained throughout
- Pagination logic must work with dynamic filter context
- Cannot break existing team/candidate list functionality
