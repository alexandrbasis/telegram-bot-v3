# Task: Payment Amount Validation and Status Management
**Created**: 2025-09-10 | **Status**: Ready for Implementation

## GATE 1: Business Requirements Approval (MANDATORY)
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-09-10

### Business Context
Implement automatic payment status management when payment amounts are edited to maintain data consistency and business rule compliance.

### Primary Objective
Ensure payment amounts and payment status remain synchronized and valid when participants' payment information is edited through the Telegram bot.

### Use Cases
1. **Zero Amount Scenario**: When editing payment amount to exactly zero
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Payment amount field is set to 0 in database
     - Payment status changes to "неоплачено" (unpaid)
     - Payment date is removed/cleared from the record
   - **Expected Behavior**: Complete reset of payment information to unpaid state

2. **Negative Amount Scenario**: When payment amount is edited to a negative value
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
     - Payment amount is automatically corrected to 0 in database
     - Payment status changes from "оплачено" (paid) to "неоплачено" (unpaid)
     - Payment date is removed/cleared from the record
   - **Expected Behavior**: Complete reset of payment information to unpaid state

3. **Data Integrity Scenario**: Prevent invalid payment states in the system
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: No participant can have negative payment amount
   - **Expected Behavior**: System automatically corrects invalid states during editing

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of negative payment amounts are automatically corrected to zero
- [ ] Payment status consistency: no records with negative amounts and "paid" status
- [ ] Zero data loss: payment date clearing only occurs when transitioning to unpaid status
- [ ] User experience: changes happen transparently without additional user confirmation

### Constraints
- Must work within existing participant editing workflow
- Changes must be applied to Airtable database immediately
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing payment records
- Should not require additional user interactions or confirmations

## GATE 2: Test Plan Review & Approval (MANDATORY)
**Status**: ✅ Approved | **Approved by**: User | **Date**: 2025-09-10

### Test Coverage Strategy
Target: 90%+ coverage across all implementation areas

### Proposed Test Categories

#### Business Logic Tests
- [ ] **Zero Amount Payment Reset Test**: Verify payment amount set to 0, status changed to "неоплачено", payment date cleared when amount edited to 0
- [ ] **Negative Amount Correction Test**: Verify negative payment amount automatically corrected to 0 with full status reset
- [ ] **Payment Status Consistency Test**: Verify no records can exist with negative amounts and "paid" status
- [ ] **Payment Date Clearing Test**: Verify payment date field is properly cleared when transitioning to unpaid status

#### State Transition Tests  
- [ ] **Edit Dialog Payment Validation Flow**: Test payment amount validation during participant editing workflow
- [ ] **Save Confirmation with Payment Changes**: Test save workflow when payment amount triggers status changes
- [ ] **Cancel Workflow with Payment Validation**: Test cancel behavior doesn't leave invalid payment states

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] **Airtable Update Failure with Payment Changes**: Test retry mechanism when payment status update fails
- [ ] **Invalid Payment Field Values**: Test handling of non-numeric or malformed payment amount inputs
- [ ] **Concurrent Edit Conflict**: Test behavior when payment is modified during edit session

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Airtable Payment Field Updates**: Test actual database updates for payment amount, status, and date fields
- [ ] **Payment Status Field Mapping**: Test correct field ID mapping for payment status in Airtable
- [ ] **Payment Date Field Clearing**: Test proper clearing of payment date field in Airtable records

#### User Interaction Tests
- [ ] **Payment Edit User Experience**: Test user sees appropriate feedback when payment validation triggers
- [ ] **Payment Status Display**: Test updated payment information displays correctly after validation
- [ ] **Edit Confirmation Messages**: Test confirmation screens show payment status changes clearly

### Test-to-Requirement Mapping
- Zero Amount Scenario → Tests: Zero Amount Payment Reset Test, Edit Dialog Payment Validation Flow
- Negative Amount Scenario → Tests: Negative Amount Correction Test, Payment Status Consistency Test  
- Data Integrity Scenario → Tests: Payment Status Consistency Test, Concurrent Edit Conflict Test

### Test File Locations
- `tests/unit/test_services/test_participant_update_service.py`: Business logic tests (extend existing)
- `tests/unit/test_bot_handlers/test_edit_participant_handlers.py`: Dialog flow tests (extend existing)
- `tests/integration/test_payment_automation_workflow.py`: Database integration tests (extend existing)

## GATE 3: Technical Decomposition (REVISED)

### Existing Code Analysis
The current `ParticipantUpdateService` already contains:
- `_validate_payment_amount(user_input)`: Validates payment amounts and rejects negatives (lines 92-114)
- `is_paid_amount(amount)`: Determines if amount >= 1 qualifies for payment automation (lines 238-248)  
- `get_automated_payment_fields(amount)`: Returns `{"payment_status": PAID, "payment_date": today()}` for positive amounts (lines 250-260)

### Gap Analysis
**Missing functionality**: Zero amount handling needs to reset payment status to UNPAID and clear payment date.

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Enhance existing `get_automated_payment_fields()` method to handle zero amounts with UNPAID status reset
- [ ] Ensure the enhanced method is called during participant save workflow for zero amounts
- [ ] Verify integration with existing edit handlers and Airtable field mappings
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for payment status reset events

### Implementation Steps & Change Log

#### Step 1: Enhance Existing Payment Automation Logic
- [ ] Sub-step 1.1: Modify `get_automated_payment_fields()` method to handle zero amounts
  - **Directory**: `src/services/`
  - **Files to create/modify**: `src/services/participant_update_service.py` (lines 250-260)
  - **Accept**: Method returns `{"payment_status": UNPAID, "payment_date": None}` when amount == 0
  - **Tests**: `tests/unit/test_services/test_participant_update_service.py` (extend existing tests)

## GATE 5: Task Splitting Evaluation (MANDATORY)
**Status**: ✅ Evaluated | **Evaluated by**: Task Splitter Agent | **Date**: 2025-09-10
**Decision**: No Split Needed
**Reasoning**: Task involves minimal code changes (~30-40 lines) implementing single atomic business rule using existing patterns. Splitting would create artificial fragmentation without technical benefit.

**Task Scope Analysis:**
- **Code Changes**: Single method enhancement in one service file  
- **Lines of Impact**: ~5-10 core implementation lines, ~20-30 test extension lines
- **Files Modified**: 1 service file, 2-3 existing test files extended
- **Integration Points**: Zero new integrations (uses existing payment automation patterns)

**Why No Split Needed:**
- Single atomic business rule: "zero amount payment reset"
- Well-contained scope within existing service class
- Low review complexity (15-minute review)
- No natural technical breaking points
- Splitting would create coordination overhead without benefit
