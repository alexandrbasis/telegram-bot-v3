## Requirements Compliance

### ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] **Use Case 1 - Acceptance Criteria 1**: Message includes "–í—Å–µ–≥–æ –∫–∞–Ω–¥–∏–¥–∞—Ç–æ–≤" line showing count of participants with role=CANDIDATE - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. Verified in `src/services/daily_notification_service.py:64` with proper üë§ emoji and Russian text.

- [x] **Use Case 1 - Acceptance Criteria 2**: "–í—Å–µ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥" renamed to "–í—Å–µ —á–ª–µ–Ω—ã –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã" - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. Verified in `src/services/daily_notification_service.py:65` with proper üë´ emoji.

- [x] **Use Case 1 - Acceptance Criteria 3**: Department breakdown remains unchanged and shows under "–í—Å–µ —á–ª–µ–Ω—ã –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã" - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. Department logic preserved, only indentation increased for visual grouping.

- [x] **Use Case 1 - Acceptance Criteria 4**: Department breakdown is indented to show relationship to team members - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. 2 spaces for "–ü–æ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–∞–º:" header, 4 spaces for department items (`daily_notification_service.py:67,77`).

- [x] **Use Case 1 - Acceptance Criteria 5**: Mathematical correctness (total_participants = total_candidates + total_team_members) - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. Validated through `test_mathematical_correctness_candidates_plus_teams` and verified in actual statistics collection logic.

- [x] **Use Case 2 - All Criteria**: Statistics calculation accuracy - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. Candidate counting implemented correctly in `src/services/statistics_service.py:89-91`, properly integrated with DepartmentStatistics model construction.

- [x] **Header Format Update**: Header changed from "–ï–∂–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤" to "–°—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ DD.MM.YYYY" - ‚úÖ **Excellent**. Date formatting uses strftime("%d.%m.%Y") as specified.

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete

None. All requirements fully implemented.

## Quality Assessment

**Overall**: ‚úÖ Excellent
**Architecture**: ‚úÖ Excellent - Follows existing service layer patterns, maintains separation of concerns (StatisticsService for data collection, DailyNotificationService for formatting)
**Standards**: ‚úÖ Excellent - Code is readable, follows project conventions, uses proper type hints, Pydantic validation patterns
**Security**: ‚úÖ Excellent - No security concerns, no new credentials, no sensitive data exposure

## Testing & Documentation

**Testing**: ‚úÖ Excellent
**Test Execution Results**:
- **Modified Components**: 37/37 tests passed in 0.11s (100% pass rate)
- **Full Test Suite**: 1680 passed, 9 skipped in 7.15s (100% pass rate on active tests)
- **Edge Cases Covered**:
  - All candidates scenario (teams=0)
  - All teams scenario (candidates=0)

## Issues Checklist

### üö® Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)

None.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major (Should Fix)

None.

### üí° Minor (Nice to Fix)

None. Implementation is clean and production-ready.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

None required. Implementation is approved for merge.

### Future Improvements

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Consider adding metrics tracking for notification delivery latency as the participant database grows (currently O(n) with single pass, which is optimal).

2. **Localization Enhancement**: Current hardcoded Russian translations could be extracted to a centralized localization file if additional languages are planned in the future. However, this is not necessary for the current single-language requirement.

3. **Message Format Configurability**: If administrators need customizable message formats in the future, consider extracting the message template to configuration. Not needed now but good to keep in mind.

## Final Decision

**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR MERGE

**Criteria Met**:
‚úÖ All requirements implemented correctly
‚úÖ Quality standards exceeded (excellent code quality, comprehensive tests)
‚úÖ Adequate test coverage (90%+ on all modified files, 100% pass rate)
‚úÖ Complete documentation (task document, code comments, commit messages)
‚úÖ All quality gates passed (mypy: 0 errors, flake8: 0 issues, black/isort: formatted)
‚úÖ No breaking changes (fully backward compatible)
‚úÖ Mathematical correctness validated
‚úÖ TDD approach followed throughout

## Developer Instructions

### Merge Process:
1. **PR is approved and ready to merge** - No additional changes needed
2. **Merge strategy**: Squash and merge recommended (or merge commit to preserve 5 logical commits)

## Code Quality Highlights

### What This Implementation Does Exceptionally Well

1. **Pydantic Model Validation**: The `total_candidates` field includes proper validation (`ge=0`) consistent with existing fields, preventing negative values at the model level.

2. **Single-Pass Aggregation**: Statistics service counts both candidates and teams in a single iteration through participants (O(n)), maintaining optimal performance.

3. **Localization Consistency**: Uses existing `department_to_russian()` utility function for translations, maintaining consistency across the codebase.

4. **Mathematical Correctness**: Implementation explicitly validates that `total_participants = total_candidates + total_teams` through dedicated test case, ensuring data integrity.

5. **Test Coverage**: Edge cases thoroughly covered including empty lists, all-candidates, all-teams scenarios, and proper assertions on mathematical relationships.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing 1680 tests pass with minimal fixture updates (only adding required `total_candidates` field), demonstrating no breaking changes.

7. **Commit Hygiene**: Atomic commits following conventional commit format (feat:, style:, docs:) with clear, descriptive messages and logical separation of concerns.
