# Changelog Generator

**Purpose**: Generate changelog entries from completed task documents and update CHANGELOG.md

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Read task document, extract changes made, and add structured changelog entry to CHANGELOG.md

## INPUT
- **Task Document**: `docs/tasks/[latest].md` with implementation details
- **Target File**: `/CHANGELOG.md` in project root

## CHANGELOG FORMAT
Follow Keep a Changelog format:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- New feature descriptions

### Changed  
- Modified functionality descriptions

### Fixed
- Bug fix descriptions

### Removed
- Deprecated feature removals
```

## WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Analyze Task Document
- Read task file to understand what was implemented
- Extract business requirements, technical changes, and user impact
- Identify specific files, folders, and line numbers where changes were made
- Identify change type: Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed

### Step 2: Categorize Changes
Based on task content, categorize as:
- **Added**: New features, commands, functionality
- **Changed**: Modified existing behavior, improvements  
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes, issue resolutions
- **Removed**: Deprecated features, cleanup

### Step 3: Generate Changelog Entry
- Write clear, user-focused description with code references
- Include specific file paths and line numbers where applicable (e.g., `src/models/user.py:45`)
- Include folder references for broader changes (e.g., `src/handlers/`, `tests/`)
- Include version number if specified in task
- Add date of completion
- Focus on user impact while providing technical context through code references

### Step 4: Update CHANGELOG.md
- Add entry to appropriate section (Unreleased or versioned)
- Maintain chronological order
- Preserve existing format and structure

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT
For a task about adding user authentication:
```markdown
### Added
- User authentication system with login/logout commands (`src/handlers/auth.py:12-45`, `src/models/user.py:78`)
- Secure session management for bot users (`src/services/session.py`, `src/utils/security.py:23`)
- Role-based access control for admin features (`src/middleware/auth.py:56-89`, `src/models/`)
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Changelog entry accurately reflects task implementation
- User-focused language explaining impact with technical context
- Code references include specific file paths and line numbers where applicable
- Folder references used for broader structural changes
- Proper categorization and formatting
- CHANGELOG.md updated and committed
