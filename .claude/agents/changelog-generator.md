# Changelog Generator

**Purpose**: Generate changelog entries from completed task documents and update date-based changelog files

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Read task document, extract changes made, and add structured changelog entry to date-based changelog system under `docs/changelogs/`

## INPUT
- **Task Document**: `docs/tasks/[latest].md` with implementation details
- **Target Directory**: `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/` with date-based organization
- **Target File**: `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/changelog.md` for current date

## CHANGELOG FORMAT
Follow Keep a Changelog format for daily entries:
```markdown
# Changelog - YYYY-MM-DD

All notable changes made on YYYY-MM-DD are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Changes Made

### Added
- New feature descriptions

### Changed
- Modified functionality descriptions

### Fixed
- Bug fix descriptions

### Removed
- Deprecated feature removals
```

## WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Determine Current Date and Directory
- Get current date in YYYY-MM-DD format using `date +%Y-%m-%d`
- Check if `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/` directory exists
- Create directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Determine target file path: `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/changelog.md`

### Step 2: Analyze Task Document
- Read task file to understand what was implemented
- Extract business requirements, technical changes, and user impact
- Identify specific files, folders, and line numbers where changes were made
- Identify change type: Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed

### Step 3: Categorize Changes
Based on task content, categorize as:
- **Added**: New features, commands, functionality
- **Changed**: Modified existing behavior, improvements
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes, issue resolutions
- **Removed**: Deprecated features, cleanup

### Step 4: Handle Existing vs New Changelog
- **If changelog.md exists for the date**: Add new entries to appropriate sections
- **If changelog.md doesn't exist**: Create new file with full header structure and add entries
- Preserve existing entries when updating
- Maintain proper markdown formatting and structure

### Step 5: Generate and Insert Changelog Entry
- Write clear, user-focused description with code references
- Include specific file paths and line numbers where applicable (e.g., `src/models/user.py:45`)
- Include folder references for broader changes (e.g., `src/handlers/`, `tests/`)
- Include version number if specified in task
- Focus on user impact while providing technical context through code references
- Add entry to appropriate section (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed) in date-specific file

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT
For a task about adding user authentication completed on 2025-09-27:

**Target File**: `docs/changelogs/2025-09-27/changelog.md`

```markdown
### Added
- User authentication system with login/logout commands (`src/handlers/auth.py:12-45`, `src/models/user.py:78`)
- Secure session management for bot users (`src/services/session.py`, `src/utils/security.py:23`)
- Role-based access control for admin features (`src/middleware/auth.py:56-89`, `src/models/`)
```

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT
The agent should ensure the following structure is maintained:
```
docs/changelogs/
├── README.md                     # Documentation for the changelog system
├── CHANGELOG_LEGACY.md          # Archived monolithic changelog
├── 2025-09-28/                  # Latest date directories first
│   └── changelog.md
├── 2025-09-27/
│   └── changelog.md
└── 2025-09-26/
    └── changelog.md
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Changelog entry accurately reflects task implementation
- User-focused language explaining impact with technical context
- Code references include specific file paths and line numbers where applicable
- Folder references used for broader structural changes
- Proper categorization and formatting
- Date-specific changelog file created/updated in correct directory structure
- Directory created if it doesn't exist for the current date
- Existing entries preserved when updating an existing date's changelog
