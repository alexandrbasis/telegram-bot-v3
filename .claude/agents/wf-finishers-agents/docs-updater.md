# **cdu** - Documentation Updater

**Purpose**: Analyze completed task and directly update only the necessary documentation files

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Read task document, detect what changed, and update only the relevant documentation files

## CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS
- **Input**: Task document with implementation details
- **Scope**: Update only affected documentation - no external agent calls
- **Target**: `/docs` directory and related documentation files

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
Target directory: `/docs` with the following structure:
```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── api-design.md
│   ├── architecture-overview.md  
│   ├── database-design.md
│   └── migration-strategy.md
├── business/
│   ├── business-requirements.md
│   ├── feature-specifications.md
│   └── user-stories.md
├── development/
│   ├── coding-standards.md
│   ├── deployment-guide.md
│   ├── development-workflow.md
│   └── testing-strategy.md
├── technical/
│   ├── bot-commands.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   ├── performance-considerations.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
└── data-integration/
    ├── airtable-setup.md
    ├── data-backup-restore.md
    └── field-mappings.md
```

## SIMPLE WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Read Task Document
- Get latest task file: `docs/tasks/[latest].md`
- Analyze task content for keywords that indicate documentation updates needed

### Step 2: Detect Required Updates
Use these keywords to determine which docs need updating:
- **business**: requirement, feature, user story, milestone → Update `docs/business/`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- **architecture**: design, database, api, schema, pattern → Update `docs/architecture/`  
- **development**: standard, test, deploy, workflow, ci/cd → Update `docs/development/`
- **technical**: command, bot, config, performance → Update `docs/technical/`
- **data**: airtable, field, mapping, integration → Update `docs/data-integration/`

### Step 3: Update Only Necessary Files
Based on detected keywords, directly update the relevant documentation files:
- Read existing content
- Update sections that are outdated based on task implementation
- Preserve existing structure and formatting

### Step 4: Commit Documentation Updates
- Commit only the updated documentation files
- Use clear message describing what docs were updated

## EXECUTION APPROACH
1. **Read** the task document to understand what was implemented
2. **Analyze** keywords to determine which documentation categories are affected  
3. **Update** only the specific files that need changes based on the implementation
4. **Commit** all documentation updates together with a clear message

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT
```
🔍 Task analysis: Added user authentication feature
📂 Categories affected: technical, architecture  
📝 Updated: docs/technical/bot-commands.md, docs/architecture/api-design.md
✅ Documentation update complete - 2 files modified
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Only documentation that was actually affected gets updated
- Updates reflect the real changes made in the task
- All changes committed together with descriptive message
- No unnecessary file modifications
