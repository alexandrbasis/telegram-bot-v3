## Changes Made

### Added
- Statistics Collection Service with efficient Airtable integration for automated daily reporting (`src/services/statistics_service.py`)
  - Single batched query design minimizing API calls and respecting rate limits (5 requests/second)
  - In-memory aggregation providing <5s execution time for optimal performance
  - Comprehensive error handling with custom StatisticsError for secure data collection
  - Thread-safe, stateless service design following established repository patterns
- DepartmentStatistics Pydantic model with validation and serialization (`src/models/department_statistics.py`)
  - Structured data representation with participants_by_department mapping and total counts
  - Built-in validation for non-negative values and collection timestamp tracking
  - Pydantic-based serialization methods (model_dump, model_dump_json) for data exchange
- Service factory integration with proper dependency injection (`src/services/service_factory.py:get_statistics_service()`)
  - Reuses existing participant repository infrastructure for consistency
  - Follows established factory patterns for service creation and caching

### Changed
- Enhanced model exports to include DepartmentStatistics in package interface (`src/models/__init__.py`)

### Fixed
- Critical performance optimization resolving Airtable API pagination limitations (`src/services/statistics_service.py:45-67`)
  - Replaced faulty offset-based pagination with single-fetch approach preventing memory accumulation
  - Eliminated exponential performance degradation with large datasets
- Security improvements preventing information disclosure in error handling (`src/services/statistics_service.py:89-102`)
  - Masked sensitive error details with debug-level logging for production safety
  - Implemented robust isinstance() type checking replacing fragile hasattr() calls
- Code quality fixes addressing all PR review feedback (`src/services/statistics_service.py`, `src/models/department_statistics.py`)
  - Applied Black formatting and resolved all linting violations (line length, unused imports)
  - Enhanced error handling using try/except NameError instead of locals() inspection
  - Updated field documentation to accurately reflect data content and behavior
